# Cross-Agent Distribution

Full-Stack Marketing OS is a **portable skill and marketing operating system** with a governed runtime-neutral integration contract. A marketplace plugin is an optional distribution wrapper, not a prerequisite for system completeness.

The canonical source of behavior is always [`.agents/skills/`](.agents/skills/). Runtime installs, knowledge exports, host integrations, and optional plugin packages are distribution layers. They must not become competing sources of truth.

Platform notes below were verified against current OpenAI and Anthropic documentation on **2026-09-18**. Reverify platform-specific packaging and paths before changing this contract.

## Current support matrix

| Consumer | Current support | Path / method | Canonical? |
|---|---|---|---|
| OpenAI Codex | **Supported as skills** | `bash scripts/install-skills.sh . "$HOME/.codex"` → `~/.codex/skills/` | No, generated from `.agents/skills/` |
| Claude Code | **Supported as skills** | `bash scripts/install-claude-skills.sh` → `~/.claude/skills/` | No, generated from `.agents/skills/` |
| Claude Code repo instructions | **Supported** | Root `CLAUDE.md` imports `AGENTS.md` | Bridge only |
| Custom GPT knowledge | **Supported as derived knowledge** | Generated `gpt-knowledge/pack/` | No, non-executable export |
| Host connectors / MCP / APIs / browser / BI runtimes | **Supported through integration contract** | [`integrations/README.md`](integrations/README.md) + runtime-specific connection | No |
| ChatGPT/OpenAI marketplace plugin | **Optional distribution** | May package the governed skills and reference approved apps/connectors; not required for core completeness | No |
| Claude plugin | **Optional distribution** | May package the governed skills and MCP/agent surfaces; not required for core completeness | No |

## Terminology

Use **skill** when referring to a reusable task/workflow instruction package.

Use **plugin** only when an actual installable plugin package/manifest exists for the target platform. A repository containing skills is not automatically a plugin.

Use [`integrations/README.md`](integrations/README.md) for the live-data/action contract. A documented adapter is not a connected account; connection, authorization, and verification are runtime-specific states.

Use **Custom GPT knowledge export** for `gpt-knowledge/`. Knowledge files can inform a GPT but do not become governed executable skills merely because they are uploaded.

## OpenAI / Codex

OpenAI currently distinguishes skills from plugins: skills package reusable instructions/resources for ChatGPT and Codex, while plugins are installable bundles that can combine skills with connected tools such as MCP-backed connectors and optional UI.

This repository currently supports the **skill** path for local Codex:

```bash
bash scripts/install-skills.sh . "$HOME/.codex"
```

The installer copies canonical skills into the runtime's `skills/` directory and shared contracts and libraries into the dedicated `.marketing-os/` directory. It rewrites generated links and validates required skill links before publishing the installation. Each generated skill explicitly links to `.marketing-os/AGENTS.md`; personal runtime-root `AGENTS.md` and `CLAUDE.md` files are never replaced.

Same-name unmanaged skills and locally modified managed files stop the install. Identical reinstalls are a no-op; changed managed installations are backed up. Python 3 is required, and `--dry-run` validates without changing the runtime. See [`INSTALLATION_SAFETY.md`](INSTALLATION_SAFETY.md) for ownership, legacy migration, backups, and recovery limits.

The repository does not rely on an all-in-one OpenAI plugin for completeness. OpenAI plugins can package skills and connected apps, while app authorization remains separate. If this repository is packaged later, do not describe that package as published, installed, marketplace-listed, connected, or verified until the target workspace confirms those states.

## Claude Code

Claude Code currently discovers personal skills from `~/.claude/skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md` and project skills from `.claude/skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md`. Its skills use `SKILL.md` with YAML frontmatter and may load supporting files when relevant.

Install the canonical Marketing OS skills as personal Claude Code skills with:

```bash
bash scripts/install-claude-skills.sh
```

This delegates to the same canonical installer and writes generated skills to `~/.claude/skills/` with shared contracts and libraries in `~/.claude/.marketing-os/`. Existing personal instructions remain untouched. Do not edit installed copies as source material; change `.agents/skills/` in the repository and reinstall. Legacy installation conflicts are explained in [`INSTALLATION_SAFETY.md`](INSTALLATION_SAFETY.md).

When Claude Code works inside this repository, root [`CLAUDE.md`](CLAUDE.md) imports [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md), so contributor and evidence rules remain shared rather than duplicated.

Local personal skills are not the same as a Claude plugin or a cloud-distributed skill. Plugin packaging remains optional; do not claim Claude plugin/cloud installation unless that distribution has actually been configured and verified.

## Custom GPT

[`gpt-knowledge/pack/`](gpt-knowledge/pack/) is a generated knowledge-export layer for Custom GPT-style retrieval/use. Rebuild with `python3 scripts/build-gpt-knowledge.py`; `--check` detects source/export drift and missing skill coverage. The [`export guide`](gpt-knowledge/README.md) explains which files to upload. It is useful for providing reference material but is not the canonical skill layer and does not prove runtime behavior.

Capability claims must come from [`CAPABILITY-REGISTRY.md`](CAPABILITY-REGISTRY.md), not from whatever files happen to exist in `gpt-knowledge/`.

## Canonical-source rule

```text
.agents/skills/
      ↓
Canonical governed skills
      ↓
Install/export/package
      ├─ ~/.codex/skills/ + ~/.codex/.marketing-os/
      ├─ ~/.claude/skills/ + ~/.claude/.marketing-os/
      ├─ gpt-knowledge/
      └─ optional plugin packages
```

Never edit a generated runtime copy and then treat it as the new source of truth.

## Optional plugin packaging

A plugin release is a separate optional distribution artifact, not a missing capability and not a rename of the repository. Before calling a package a plugin:

1. Create the target platform's required package/manifest structure.
2. Bundle only governed skills and explicitly required resources/tools.
3. Preserve capability ownership and authorization boundaries.
4. Validate links/resources after packaging.
5. Test skill discovery and invocation in the real target runtime.
6. Verify exact install/publish/listing state before claiming the plugin is available.

Plugin packaging must not introduce a second editable skill hierarchy.
