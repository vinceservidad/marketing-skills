# Safe installation and updates

There are two supported installation paths.

## Public portable install

For most users:

```bash
npx skills add vinceservidad/marketing-skills
```

The public CLI installs generated self-contained bundles from `skills/`. Each bundle includes the shared rules and linked dependencies required by that skill. These bundles are generated from `.agents/skills/` and checked for drift in CI.

Use the CLI's own update/remove commands for installs it manages:

```bash
npx skills update
npx skills remove google-ads
```

## Advanced managed install

The repository's custom installer provides stricter ownership tracking, collision protection, namespaced shared resources, repeat-install verification, and backups.

The installer writes generated skills to `<runtime>/skills/<name>/` and shared Marketing OS contracts and libraries to `<runtime>/.marketing-os/`. It never writes global `AGENTS.md` or `CLAUDE.md`, and never replaces runtime-root `frameworks/`, `playbooks/`, `templates/`, or `workflows/` directories.

Each generated skill links explicitly to `.marketing-os/AGENTS.md`. The repository's operating rules remain available without replacing the user's personal or project instructions. Canonical source stays in `.agents/skills/`; generated copies are not a second source of truth.

## Install or preview

Python 3 is required. Existing positional commands remain supported:

```bash
bash scripts/install-skills.sh . "$HOME/.codex" --dry-run
bash scripts/install-skills.sh . "$HOME/.codex"
bash scripts/install-claude-skills.sh
```

`MARKETING_OS_INSTALL_ROOT` still supplies the default destination when the second positional argument is omitted. `--dry-run` validates sources, required skill links, and destination conflicts without creating or changing the destination runtime.

## What is protected

- Existing personal instructions, shared root libraries, and unrelated skills are left untouched. An unrelated skill's broken link does not make this package's installation fail.
- An existing skill with the same name is refused unless a valid Marketing OS ownership manifest records it. The installer does not guess that a familiar name grants overwrite permission.
- Managed files are hashed. Locally modified files, added files, missing dependencies, invalid manifests, symlink destinations, and source/destination overlap stop the install rather than silently discard work.
- Sources and skill links are validated in temporary staging before publication. A repeated install of identical content is a no-op. Changed installations back up the previous managed trees before replacing them. Retired skills leave the active skill directory but remain in the backup.
- Link rewriting preserves directory-link trailing slashes and fragments. Installed-runtime integrity checks remain enabled rather than ignoring unexpected generated-content differences.

## Migrate an older installation

Earlier installers did not record ownership. Consequently, an older installation may stop with a skill-collision message. This is deliberate.

Back up only the old Marketing OS skill directories named in the collision message and move those directories outside the runtime's `skills/` directory. Preserve unrelated skills and personal instruction files. Then rerun the installer. Do not move the entire `skills/` directory or automatically remove shared files from the runtime root.

The new installer does not delete or adopt legacy root contracts and libraries. Review those separately. It cannot reconstruct personal files overwritten by an earlier installer; recovery requires a backup made before that overwrite.

## Backups and failure recovery

A changed installation retains the previous managed trees under `<runtime>/.marketing-os-backups/<run-id>/`. That backup includes its ownership manifest. Successful installation prints the exact backup path.

An ordinary publication error triggers restoration of the previous managed trees. The exclusive `.marketing-os-install.lock` prevents cooperating installers from publishing concurrently. Do not remove the lock while an installer is running.

A process kill, machine crash, disk failure, or failure during rollback itself is not covered by a crash-safe transaction guarantee. In that situation, inspect the reported error, retained backup, and lock before running the installer again. Do not delete backups until recovery is verified. There is no automatic rollback CLI in this change.

## Verification and scope

Run the isolated regression suites:

```bash
python3 -m unittest discover -s tests -p 'test_install_*.py' -v
```

The `Installer safety` workflow runs the safety and link-rewriting suites, a full-repository managed installation, a repeat-install check, installed-runtime integrity validation, the Claude wrapper on Ubuntu and macOS, and a separate smoke test using the real public `skills` CLI. The skill-link check covers this package's generated skill files and their references, not every link in all repository documentation. These tests validate installation mechanics, not model decision quality or live agent discovery.

This is a focused reliability change. It does not add skills, generate GPT exports, merge PR #27, or claim a measured improvement in marketing outcomes. PR #27 must preserve this installation-safety contract when its broader distribution work is reconciled.
