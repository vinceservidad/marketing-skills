# Copywriting

Classify each framework, structure, or heuristic with [`KNOWLEDGE-TAXONOMY.md`](_shared/KNOWLEDGE-TAXONOMY.md). A copywriting structure (AIDA, PAS, FAB, BAB) is a pattern that organizes an argument — it is not evidence that the argument is true, and applying it correctly does not make an unsupported claim supportable.

Per [`CAPABILITY-REGISTRY.md`](_shared/CAPABILITY-REGISTRY.md), paid-ad hooks, angles, concepts, and static paid-creative text hierarchy stay owned by `$creative-strategy`; landing-page and product-page conversion copy stays owned by `$cro`. This skill owns what those do not: email and lifecycle sequences, website and sales-page copy, long-form content, and brand voice — the copywriting work with no other current owner.

## Context

Primary business outcome and funnel stage the copy serves; audience — priority segment, buying situation, or Jobs-to-be-Done per `$icp-jtbd` where available; evidence-backed customer language available from `$customer-research`, with its provenance; brand voice guidelines if they exist; the specific claim or offer being communicated and what supports it; and the channel and format constraints (subject line length, email client rendering, page length).

## Method

1. State the single audience, single problem, and single promise the copy must serve — per the Rule of One. A piece of copy trying to serve two audiences or two promises weakens both.
2. Verify every factual or quantitative claim against a source before writing it in; do not write a number, result, or comparison the source evidence does not support.
3. Use customer language only when it is traceable to a supplied source — an interview, review, survey response — via `$customer-research`. Do not invent or paraphrase a quotation from memory and present it as customer language.
4. Select a structure matched to the communication goal, not by default. See [Structure selection](references/structure-selection.md).
5. Draft, then apply the humanizing pass: remove unnecessary words, mechanical transitions, and any phrasing that reads as templated rather than written for this specific audience and claim.
6. For a sequence (email, lifecycle), sequence the individual pieces against the funnel stage and lifecycle definitions `$marketing-intake` recorded, and against the segmentation, trigger, and cadence design `$lifecycle-marketing` owns; a single piece is evaluated on its own persuasive logic, a sequence on its cumulative arc. This skill writes the words for a sequence; it does not design the sequence, platform, or triggers — route that to `$lifecycle-marketing`.
7. State what would need to be true for the copy to work, and flag any claim in it that is unverified or aspirational rather than evidenced.

## Rules

- Never fabricate a benchmark, result, testimonial, or customer quotation. A number or claim with no traceable source is not written into the copy; it is flagged as missing.
- Do not present a copywriting structure as a guarantee of performance; a structure organizes an argument, and whether the argument converts is an empirical question for `$cro` or `$creative-strategy` to test, not something this skill can assert.
- Do not write paid-ad hooks, angles, or static-ad type-overlay hierarchy; route those to `$creative-strategy`, including its static DTC creative-direction method. Do not write landing-page or product-page conversion copy; route those to `$cro`.
- Do not claim brand voice consistency without the brand guidelines actually supplied; write a best-effort draft and label the voice as unverified against guidelines if none exist.
- A claim of scarcity, urgency, authority, or social proof must be true and evidenced; do not manufacture false urgency or an unsupported authority claim.
- For regulated or compliance-sensitive claims (health, financial, legal outcome claims), do not write a claim beyond what the supplied evidence supports, and flag the claim for review rather than softening it silently.

## Output

Draft: audience, problem, and promise stated; structure used and why; every factual claim with its source; customer language with its provenance; humanized draft; flagged unverified or aspirational claims; exact status (draft, approved, published).

Evaluation: what structure is present; claims verified against source versus unverified; customer-language provenance checked; single-audience/single-promise discipline assessed; recommended revision.

## QA

Confirm audience, problem, and promise are singular and stated; every factual claim traces to a source; every customer-language use traces to a supplied source via `$customer-research`; the structure fits the communication goal rather than being applied by default; no paid-ad hook or landing-page conversion copy was written here instead of routed; and no claim exceeds what the evidence supports.
