name: activation
description: Define and improve the post-conversion path to first meaningful customer value using evidence-backed activation criteria, time-to-value, friction diagnosis, and controlled interventions; not for inventing an “aha moment,” treating onboarding completion as value by default, or taking over CRO, lifecycle messaging, retention strategy, product implementation, or retention economics.

# Activation

Activation owns the decision between acquisition/conversion and ongoing retention: what behavior or outcome credibly represents first meaningful value, how customers reach it, where they fail to reach it, and which interventions should be tested. Once the customer has reached first meaningful value, `$retention-strategy` owns why they later fail to continue, renew, repurchase, or return and which retention intervention should be tested.

Activation is not automatically a stage every business needs. If the purchase or conversion itself substantially realizes the promised value and there is no meaningful post-conversion setup/use milestone, state that no separate activation layer is decision-relevant rather than forcing a SaaS funnel onto the business.

Classify activation artifacts with [`KNOWLEDGE-TAXONOMY.md`](_shared/KNOWLEDGE-TAXONOMY.md). An activation heuristic or common “aha moment” pattern is a hypothesis input, not evidence that a specific event predicts value or retention for this business.

## Inputs

Before a decision-grade activation recommendation, confirm:

- business model, primary business outcome, and lifecycle-stage definitions
- promised outcome and product/service truth
- post-conversion customer journey from signup/purchase/lead acceptance to first meaningful value
- candidate value events and their instrumentation quality
- customer research, support/success evidence, usability evidence, and observed behavior where available
- segment/cohort definitions and expected time-to-value range
- downstream retention, repeat-use, renewal, refund, or qualified-revenue evidence when available
- operational/product/service constraints and authorization boundary

If the value event cannot be measured reliably, route instrumentation integrity to `$tracking-measurement` before treating activation rate as decision-ready.

## Method

1. **Confirm whether a distinct activation stage exists.** Identify the conversion boundary and ask whether meaningful customer value occurs after it. Do not manufacture a stage when the conversion itself is the useful outcome.
2. **Define first meaningful value.** Use [Activation definition and evidence](references/activation-definition-and-evidence.md). Separate customer value from business convenience and from easy-to-track onboarding events.
3. **Map the path to value.** Use [Path to value and friction](references/path-to-value-and-friction.md). Map required steps, dependencies, wait states, handoffs, customer effort, uncertainty, and failure points.
4. **Measure activation correctly.** State eligible denominator, activation event, window, segment, exclusions, instrumentation state, and time-to-value distribution. Do not report one blended rate across incompatible cohorts or journey variants.
5. **Diagnose the first binding barrier.** Distinguish product/service availability, setup complexity, comprehension, motivation, trust, missing data/integration, operational delay, poor-fit acquisition, technical defect, and measurement failure.
6. **Choose the smallest meaningful intervention.** Remove unnecessary friction, improve guidance, change sequencing, add assistance, clarify expectations, or redesign a handoff only where evidence supports the mechanism. Route owned-channel trigger/cadence design to `$lifecycle-marketing`, wording to `$copywriting`, and surface-level conversion UX to `$cro` where relevant.
7. **Define the test and guardrails.** Use [Activation experiments and handoffs](references/activation-experiments-and-handoffs.md). Primary outcome should reflect meaningful value or a validated activation proxy; guardrails may include refund/cancellation, support burden, quality, safety/compliance, retention, and downstream revenue.
8. **Record learning and exact state.** Proposed activation definitions remain hypotheses until evidence supports them. Implemented journey changes are not verified until the expected behavior and downstream guardrails are observed. If the remaining problem occurs after first meaningful value, hand the intervention question to `$retention-strategy` rather than extending Activation indefinitely.

## Rules

- Do not call an event “activation” merely because it is common in the category, easy to instrument, or correlated in one unadjusted analysis.
- Do not invent an “aha moment.” If several candidate events exist, preserve uncertainty and design evidence collection or testing.
- Onboarding completion, tutorial completion, profile completion, email open/click, number of sessions, or feature clicks are supporting events unless evidence shows they represent or predict meaningful value in scope.
- Faster time-to-value is not universally better. Necessary qualification, safety, setup, education, compliance, or service work must not be removed just to shorten the clock.
- Do not optimize activation rate by shrinking the denominator, excluding hard customers after the fact, changing the activation window post hoc, or redefining the event after seeing results.
- Do not confuse activation with retention strategy or retention economics. Activation concerns first meaningful value; `$retention-strategy` owns cause/intervention after first value; `$retention-economics` owns repeat/renewal/churn economics after cohorts mature.
- Do not confuse activation with lifecycle messaging. `$lifecycle-marketing` owns communication triggers/cadence; activation owns the journey decision those communications support.
- Do not diagnose poor activation as onboarding friction before checking poor-fit acquisition, product/service failure, technical defects, operational delay, and measurement integrity.
- Product or service implementation changes remain outside this skill's execution authority unless an appropriate implementation owner and approval exist.
- A journey change that lifts an activation proxy but worsens refunds, cancellations, quality, support burden, safety/compliance, or downstream value is not a clean win.

## Output

Activation decision: business model and conversion boundary; whether a distinct activation layer exists; first meaningful value definition and evidence strength; eligible denominator/window/segment; activation and time-to-value baseline; path-to-value map; diagnosed barrier; intervention hypothesis; required owner handoffs; primary outcome and guardrails; experiment/validation plan; implementation dependencies; approval needs; exact status.

## QA

Confirm a distinct activation stage actually exists, the value event is not chosen for tracking convenience, denominator/window/segment are fixed before reading the result, instrumentation is decision-ready, downstream guardrails are included, plausible alternative causes are checked, lifecycle/CRO/product/retention boundaries are preserved, and no activation definition or journey change is described as proven before evidence supports it.
