# Customer Research

Classify outputs with [`KNOWLEDGE-TAXONOMY.md`](_shared/KNOWLEDGE-TAXONOMY.md): observed pattern, hypothesis, methodology, process, or recommendation. Patterns must retain provenance and cannot be reported as causal conclusions.

Produce decision-ready insights while preserving source provenance, segment differences, uncertainty, and the difference between what people say and do.

## Frame the decision

Define the marketing decision, target population, relevant buying situation, exclusions, current hypotheses, and evidence threshold. Ask only questions whose answers could change a decision.

## Method

1. Inventory first-party and external sources with dates, sample, collection method, and bias.
2. Prefer recent, relevant, behavior-linked evidence; use secondary sources for context, not fabricated certainty.
3. Extract atomic evidence with verbatim wording only when provided and permitted. Attach source, segment, and context.
4. Code patterns: trigger, job, desired outcome, barrier, anxiety, alternative, selection criterion, proof, language, and post-purchase result.
5. When reviews are a material source for creative or messaging decisions, read [Review mining for creative research](references/review-mining-for-creative.md). Include positive, neutral, and negative evidence and preserve contradictions rather than treating positive reviews as the default truth set.
6. Search for contradictions, non-buyers, churn/refund evidence, support friction, and segment splits.
7. Convert patterns into implications and tests. Keep insight, inference, and recommendation distinct.

Read [references/source-grading.md](references/source-grading.md) before combining heterogeneous sources. Read [references/interview-synthesis.md](references/interview-synthesis.md) for transcript or notes synthesis.

## Rules

- Never invent quotes, reviews, prevalence, or customer motivations.
- Use “Voice of Customer” only for traceable supplied customer language. Label model-created wording as synthesis, paraphrase, inference, or messaging hypothesis.
- Do not cherry-pick positive reviews or overweight long/emotional reviews as more representative merely because they contain richer copy material.
- A customer-reported outcome verifies that the customer reported it; it does not automatically verify causality, prevalence, clinical efficacy, or generalizability.
- Frequency is not importance; weight behavioral proximity, consequence, specificity, and segment fit.
- Do not treat leading survey answers as spontaneous customer language.
- Preserve negative and contradictory evidence instead of smoothing it into a persona.
- Remove or mask personal data that is unnecessary for the decision.

## Output

Return: research question; source table; segment and situation; evidence themes with counts only when valid; contradictions; language bank with provenance; implications; testable hypotheses; gaps and next research.

For a creative-strategy handoff, include audience situations, pain/desire/JTBD patterns, trigger moments, objections, alternatives, belief candidates, proof needs, traceable language, contradictions, and evidence gaps. Keep angle recommendations labeled as hypotheses until `$creative-strategy` evaluates them against product truth and proof.

## QA

Check every quotation is traceable, counts use a defined denominator, sources are not double-counted, review sentiment is not selectively sampled without disclosure, sample limitations are visible, observed behavior is separated from stated preference, customer-reported results are not promoted into causal claims, and recommendations do not exceed the evidence.
