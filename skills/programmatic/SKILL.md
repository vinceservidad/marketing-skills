# Programmatic

Classify each buying method, verification approach, or economics claim with [`KNOWLEDGE-TAXONOMY.md`](_shared/KNOWLEDGE-TAXONOMY.md). Programmatic buys inventory aggregated from thousands of largely unknown sites and apps through a multi-party supply chain — a fundamentally different risk profile than a single walled-garden platform (`$meta-ads`, `$tiktok-ads`, `$linkedin-ads`, `$youtube-ads`), where the platform itself curates and is directly accountable for its own inventory. Inventory quality, supply-chain cost, and fraud are the defining concerns here, not creative or targeting alone.

## Context

Primary business outcome and funnel objective; demand-side platform in use and its available inventory sources (open exchange, private marketplace, programmatic guaranteed); available first-party or contextual targeting signal, since third-party-cookie-based audience targeting is increasingly unreliable or unavailable; brand-safety and content-adjacency requirements; and whether independent verification (viewability, invalid-traffic, brand-safety measurement) is in place.

## Method

1. Assess the buying method against the objective: open exchange (broadest reach, least curated, highest fraud/quality risk), private marketplace (negotiated access to specific publishers, better quality control), and programmatic guaranteed (reserved inventory at a fixed price, most predictable but least flexible) each trade reach against quality and cost predictability differently — state which is used and why.
2. Screen inventory quality and supply-chain cost before scaling spend. See [Supply-path optimization](references/supply-path-optimization.md).
3. Require independent, third-party verification for viewability, invalid traffic, and brand safety rather than accepting the DSP's or a single seller's self-reported figures alone. See [Verification and fraud screening](references/verification-and-fraud-screening.md).
4. Set targeting from available first-party or contextual signal, and state explicitly where third-party-cookie-dependent targeting is degraded or unavailable rather than assuming a targeting configuration still functions as it did in a prior period.
5. Define the measurement plan against the funnel objective, applying the same view-through discipline `$youtube-ads` applies: a served impression is not a caused outcome, and any causal claim should be graded on `$tracking-measurement`'s evidence ladder.
6. Rank actions by expected business impact, confidence, reversibility, and the account's actual capacity to monitor a fragmented, multi-party supply chain on an ongoing basis.

## Rules

- Do not accept a DSP's or single supply-side platform's self-reported viewability, brand-safety, or invalid-traffic figures as sufficient; require independent third-party verification, since the reporting party frequently has a financial interest in favorable numbers.
- Do not treat open-exchange inventory as equivalent in quality to a private marketplace or programmatic-guaranteed deal without evidence; the open exchange includes the least curated, highest-fraud-risk supply by construction.
- Do not scale spend into inventory whose supply path has not been screened; an unscreened path can route through multiple resellers each taking a fee, and can include made-for-advertising sites optimized to generate ad calls rather than genuine audience engagement.
- Do not present a served or viewable impression as a caused business outcome; grade any resulting claim on the causal evidence ladder in `$tracking-measurement`, the same discipline `$youtube-ads` applies to view-through.
- Do not assume a targeting configuration that relied on third-party cookies still functions as in a prior period without confirming current signal availability; state degraded or unavailable targeting explicitly rather than reporting reach as if unaffected.
- Do not conflate cost per impression across supply paths with different fee structures; a lower headline cost per impression through a longer, fee-stacked resale path can be more expensive in total than a shorter, direct path with a higher headline rate.

## Output

Plan: buying method and rationale; supply-path screening approach; verification vendor and metrics in place; targeting signal available and any degradation disclosed; measurement plan with evidence-level expectation; capacity to monitor ongoing supply quality; exact status.

Diagnosis: observed change (cost, viewability, invalid-traffic rate, or outcome); competing explanations (supply-path shift, verification-vendor methodology change, seasonality, targeting-signal degradation) considered before attributing a cause; evidence level; recommended action.

## QA

Confirm the buying method is stated with rationale rather than defaulted; supply-path screening happened before scaling spend; verification relies on an independent third party rather than the seller's self-report; targeting-signal degradation is disclosed rather than assumed away; no served impression is presented as a caused outcome without evidence-level grading; and total supply-chain cost, not headline cost per impression alone, informs any efficiency conclusion.
