# Scaling Proof Standard

Assign the highest supported level; do not skip levels by assertion.

| Level | Status | Required meaning |
|---|---|---|
| S0 | Unverified | Recommendation, assumption, or claim without decision-ready account evidence |
| S1 | Officially documented | Platform capability documented; availability and impact unverified |
| S2 | Account-visible | Capability or condition observed in the scoped account and date |
| S3 | Analytically supported | Historical evidence supports a hypothesis; causality not isolated |
| S4 | Experimentally validated | Controlled comparison supports the mechanism within the test scope |
| S5 | Business-verified | Source of truth confirms an acceptable commercial or qualified result |
| S6 | Replicated | Result survives another meaningful period, cohort, entity, or scaling step |
| S7 | Currently scalable | Replicated result remains within current economics, capacity, measurement, and risk gates |

“Proven” means proven for the named account, scope, period, outcome definition, and evidence standard. Platform documentation, forecasts, recommendations, attributed results, or statistical significance alone do not establish business-verified scalability.

For high-risk changes, require stronger replication, smaller exposure, or credible incrementality evidence. Record contradictory results and regression conditions.

Credible incrementality evidence means a graded causal result, not platform attribution. S4 requires a controlled comparison at C3 or above on the [causal evidence ladder](../_shared/.agents/skills/tracking-measurement/references/causal-evidence-ladder.md); `$tracking-measurement` owns method selection and grading. Platform-attributed performance is C0 and cannot raise a claim above S3 regardless of volume or consistency.
