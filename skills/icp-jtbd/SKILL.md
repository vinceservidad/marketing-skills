# ICP and Jobs-to-be-Done

Classify segment and competitive outputs with [`KNOWLEDGE-TAXONOMY.md`](_shared/KNOWLEDGE-TAXONOMY.md): model, methodology, process, pattern, hypothesis, or strategy. Do not turn a research pattern, competitor observation, or market estimate into a universal segment truth.

Build actionable segment choices around valuable, reachable customers in a specific buying situation.

## Inputs

Use customer and pipeline outcomes, revenue and margin, retention/refunds, sales-cycle data, product fit, use cases, customer research, channel reachability, operational capacity, current alternatives, competitive evidence, and strategic constraints. If evidence is sparse, produce hypotheses and a collection plan rather than a definitive ICP or competitive conclusion.

When `.agents/marketing-context.md` exists, read only the relevant market, segment, customer-evidence, and positioning sections. The shared context does not replace source evidence or a fresher specialist artifact.

## Method

1. Separate market, account/customer segment, buyer/user roles, and buying situation.
2. Identify the job as progress sought in context: `When [situation], help me [motivation/progress], so I can [desired outcome].`
3. Map functional, emotional, and social dimensions only when evidence supports them.
4. Identify triggers, current alternatives, switching forces, selection criteria, anxieties, and success signals.
5. When the decision depends on competitors or category structure, map direct, different-solution, internal/manual, and status-quo alternatives using [Competitive Intelligence](references/competitive-intelligence.md). Keep competitor facts, customer evidence, market estimates, inferences, and strategic implications separate.
6. Evaluate segments on outcome value, product fit, urgency, reachability, evidence strength, sales/servicing cost, retention potential, competitive pressure or whitespace, and strategic fit.
7. Choose explicit priority, secondary, experimental, and excluded segments with reasons.

## Rules

- Do not use demographics as a substitute for need, situation, economics, or reachability.
- Do not average incompatible buyers into one persona.
- Revenue alone does not define an ICP; include margin, retention, cost-to-serve, close probability, and capacity where available.
- Distinguish user, buyer, approver, and blocker in multi-stakeholder purchases.
- Treat exclusions as strategic focus, not claims about people.
- Prefer “priority customer segment” where consumer context makes account-oriented ICP language unnatural. Keep ICP, persona, buying committee, buying situation, and JTBD distinct.
- Do not define the competitive set only by products that look similar. Include different solutions, internal/manual approaches, and status quo when they compete for the same job.
- Do not infer buyer preference, market share, or tactic effectiveness from competitor pages, traffic estimates, follower counts, ad volume, or visible creative alone.
- Do not copy competitor positioning, offers, or tactics merely because they are observable. Treat them as hypothesis inputs and preserve source/date.
- Do not label a competitor strength or weakness as fact when it is an inference from missing or indirect evidence.

## Output

Return: decision; evidence base; priority segment card; JTBD statement; trigger and switching-forces map; buying committee; value/economic fit; reachability; disqualifiers; competitive/alternative implications when relevant; messaging implications; evidence gaps and validation plan.

Competitive-intelligence request: decision and scope; segment/JTBD; alternative map; dated source table; observed strengths/constraints; customer evidence separated from competitor self-description; changes over time; strategic implications; prohibited inferences; stale/unknown/contradicted items; validation plan; exact status.

Owned root artifacts, read when their scope applies:

- [lead-generation.md](_shared/playbooks/lead-generation.md) — lead-generation segment and message workflow.
- [marketing-audit.md](_shared/templates/marketing-audit.md) — business and market-level audit format, distinct in scope from a channel audit.

## QA

Check the segment is distinguishable and reachable, the job describes progress rather than a product feature, economics are visible, roles are not conflated, exclusions are evidence-safe, certainty matches the source quality, the real alternative set includes status quo where relevant, competitor observations are dated and sourced, customer truth is not inferred from competitor marketing, and visible tactics are not called proven.
