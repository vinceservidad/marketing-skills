# Artifact Ownership

Every substantial active marketing artifact must have an identifiable owner, a discoverable loading path, a declared evidence state, and a validation rule. Existence in the repository alone does not make a file part of the operating system.

This registry records the ownership state of root-level `frameworks/`, `playbooks/`, `templates/`, and `workflows/`. `scripts/validate-skill-architecture.sh` enforces it: a **new** file added to those directories without an entry here fails validation. Existing entries marked `migration-debt` are reported, not failed — they are tracked and eliminated release by release.

Status definitions:

- **owned** — a canonical skill loads or governs the artifact.
- **consumed** — no skill loads it directly; a documented workflow, export, or human process uses it.
- **migration-debt** — active knowledge with no owner and no loading path. Must be assigned an owner, folded into a skill reference, or archived.
- **archived** — retained for history, excluded from active retrieval.

## Duplication resolved in v1.6.0

`audit-template.md` and `experiment-plan.md` were weaker duplicates — no evidence states, raw platform metrics with no profitability caveat — and were archived. `audit.md` and `experiment.md` are canonical and now owned. `marketing-audit.md` was not a duplicate: business/market-level scope distinct from a channel audit. It is now owned by `$icp-jtbd`.

## Migration rule

When migration debt is cleared, the artifact must either become a `references/` file under its owning skill, or remain a root artifact explicitly linked from that skill's `SKILL.md` and recorded here as `owned`. An artifact that cannot be assigned an owner is archived.

## v1.5.0 addition

`$retention-economics` (new skill, four references) and `optimization-scaling/references/budget-and-outcome-pacing.md` (new reference under the existing owner) are both owned at creation and require no entry here — the ownership rule applies to root `frameworks/`, `playbooks/`, `templates/`, and `workflows/`, not to skill-internal references, which are owned by construction.
