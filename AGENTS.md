# Contributor Instructions

## Operating principles

1. Start read-only. Do not change budgets, bids, campaigns, conversion goals, audiences, product coverage, offers, tracking, or live pages without explicit approval.
2. Use source-of-truth evidence. Label observed facts, calculations, inferences, assumptions, and unknowns separately.
3. Protect commercial truth. Prefer profit, realized revenue, or qualified pipeline when available; never substitute ROAS, CTR, or platform attribution for business outcome.
4. Preserve valuable coverage and learning unless evidence supports a change. Prefer reversible tests with stopping rules.
5. Distinguish draft, saved, published, live, processing, and verified states.
6. Never fabricate benchmarks, results, customer language, credentials, margins, or causality.
7. Preserve research provenance and privacy. Do not expose unnecessary personal data or report quotations without a traceable supplied source.
8. Treat platform attribution differences separately from collection defects and business-performance changes.
9. Use `GLOSSARY.md` as the canonical terminology contract. Define client-specific metric and lifecycle variants before comparing them.
10. Reserve “Primary conversion action” for the Google Ads action-optimization setting; use “primary business outcome” for the main commercial result.
11. Do not use “profit” without naming the profit level and included costs. Do not double-count discounts or refunds already included in net revenue.
12. Apply `PLATFORM-CURRENCY.md` before current Google or Meta AI, automation, control, reporting, rollout, or interface claims. Do not claim undocumented algorithm changes; distinguish official documentation, account visibility, experiments, inference, and unknowns.
13. Classify substantial operating knowledge with `KNOWLEDGE-TAXONOMY.md`. Do not present a pattern as causality, a heuristic as a best practice, a tactic as a strategy, or a framework/model as proof of an outcome.
14. Scaling requires the `optimization-scaling` readiness, economics, constraint, marginal-evidence, capacity, guardrail, and authorization gates. Never use a universal budget-increase rule or call a tactic proven outside its verified scope.
15. When `.agents/marketing-context.md` exists in the active project, read only the decision-relevant sections before substantial downstream marketing work. Treat it as a versioned context summary, never as evidence promotion: underlying specialist artifacts and source systems still govern, contradictions and stale fields stay visible, and current platform behavior still requires `PLATFORM-CURRENCY.md`.
16. Competitor observations are evidence about competitors, not customer truth or proof that a visible tactic works. Preserve date, source, estimate/inference labels, the real alternative set including status quo where relevant, and do not copy a competitor pattern merely because it is visible.
17. Experiment learning remains scoped to the valid test conditions. Assess validity before direction, preserve nulls and contradictions, separate observed effect from mechanism interpretation, and never turn one test or one external case into a universal best practice.
18. Recurring marketing loops must preserve domain ownership, durable state, idempotency, source freshness, approval scope, verification, and stop/escalation rules. A written loop is `designed`, not scheduled, active, or monitoring; never imply background execution unless the actual runtime is configured and verified.
19. Pricing decisions must separate observed purchase behavior, stated preference, competitor context, model inference, and realized economics. Never treat a competitor price, survey answer, conversion rate, arbitrary markup, price-ending heuristic, or framework default as proof of an optimal price; live commercial changes require explicit approval and source-of-truth verification.
20. Activation must represent first meaningful customer value, not tracking convenience. Do not invent an “aha moment,” use onboarding/tutorial/email completion as value by default, game denominator/window definitions, or shorten necessary qualification/safety/setup just to improve activation rate or time-to-value. Check fit, product/service failure, operations, and measurement before blaming onboarding friction.
21. Retention interventions must match a diagnosed reason. Separate voluntary loss, involuntary payment loss, lapse, and active risk; do not default to discounts, obstruct cancellation, override consent/suppression, or call delayed cancellation a durable save. Verify continuing value and economics over the decision-relevant window.
22. Growth strategy must start from a named primary business outcome, baseline, horizon, and evidence-supported limiting condition or constraint set, not a generic channel checklist. Do not force a single binding constraint when evidence supports co-limiting, independent, or unresolved constraints. Do not invent a growth target, fixed planning horizon, priority count, funnel model, channel mix, budget ratio, or benchmark-based opportunity. Preserve specialist ownership, explicit non-priorities, capacity limits, opportunity cost, decision gates, and the boundary that paid-media scaling remains under `$optimization-scaling`.
23. Marketing analytics engineering belongs to `$marketing-analytics`: declare source authority, grain, keys, join cardinality, metric semantics, time/currency basis, refresh/backfill behavior, privacy, data-quality checks, and source reconciliation before treating a warehouse, pipeline, dataset, or dashboard as trustworthy. A rendered dashboard or successful ETL job is not proof of data correctness, and the data layer does not inherit causal diagnosis or business decisions.
24. External integrations are adapters, not evidence of access. Keep documented, configured, authenticated, connected, authorized, and verified states distinct; never commit credentials or imply a live account from repository configuration. Material writes require the owning skill, explicit scope authorization, and post-write verification.

## Skill design

- Keep `SKILL.md` concise and decision-changing.
- Put conditional detail in linked references.
- Give every skill discriminating triggers, required inputs, decision rules, QA, and output shape.
- When several skills apply, appoint one owner for the final response.
- Advice may continue with missing data when safe, but confidence and decision-changing inputs must be explicit.

## Changes

- Update `CHANGELOG.md` for meaningful behavior changes.
- Add or revise evaluations for material decision-rule changes.
- Do not mark an evaluation passed without reviewing the decision, evidence handling, and authorization boundary.
