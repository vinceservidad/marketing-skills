# Scaling Constraint Identification

## Knowledge metadata

- Primary type: framework
- Secondary type: diagnostic model
- Decision: which constraint must be addressed before more growth is supportable
- Evidence status: hypothesis until localized with evidence
- Freshness: account-current

Localize the binding constraint across measurement, economics, demand, auction, budget, bid/optimization, eligibility/policy, feed, inventory, audience, creative, offer, destination, sales, fulfillment, cash flow, geography, compliance, and learning/sample.

Select a scaling mode that directly addresses the constraint and state why rejected modes do not. More budget cannot solve an inability to spend, weak unit economics, invalid measurement, exhausted creative, broken funnel, unavailable stock, or full sales capacity.

## Source: `frameworks/controlled-scaling.md`

# Controlled Scaling Framework

## Knowledge metadata

- Primary type: framework
- Secondary type: methodology / process
- Decision: continue, hold, apply, rollback, switch mode, de-scale, or remain inconclusive
- Evidence status: stable operating method; result remains account-specific
- Freshness: stable; platform implementation requires a live check

```text
Business truth → readiness → economics → constraint → mode → bounded step
→ maturity → marginal evaluation → business verification → replicate or stop
```

One step defines an exact entity/change, one major variable, maximum exposure, control/comparison, primary business metric, quality/operational guardrails, conversion-lag allowance, invalidity conditions, owner, authorization, and rollback.

There is no universal percentage or cadence. Step size follows downside, volume, lag, volatility, capacity, reversibility, and learning value.

## Source: `frameworks/creative-strategy.md`

# Creative Strategy Framework

Verified Research → Audience Situation → Pain / Desire / JTBD → Awareness → Current Belief → Required Belief Shift → Insight → Angle → Creative Mechanic → Concept → Hook → Visual Format → Persuasion → Proof → Offer → CTA → Test Hypothesis → Test → Iterate → Scale

This is a decision map, not a claim that buyers move through a fixed linear sequence. Treat awareness, belief states, mechanic fit, hook fit, and format fit as observed evidence or clearly labeled hypotheses, and use account learning to override default assumptions.

## Creative Evaluation
- Is the source insight grounded?
- Is the audience situation clear?
- Is the pain, desire, or JTBD explicit?
- Does the message match the best-supported awareness and belief state?
- Is the required belief shift supportable with available proof?
- Is the angle a distinct reason to care rather than a hook rewrite?
- Does the creative mechanic define a clear way for the concept to make the angle land?
- Is the concept distinct from the hook and visual format?
- Does the hook preserve the angle and proof boundary?
- Does the visual format serve the mechanic, product, placement, and proof requirement?
- Is there a reason to believe?
- Can the test teach something and be measured against a business outcome?

## Source: `frameworks/experimentation.md`

# Experimentation Framework

## Knowledge metadata

- Primary type: framework
- Secondary type: methodology / process
- Decision: whether a test can produce a valid decision and what scoped learning it supports
- Evidence status: stable operating method
- Freshness: stable; confirm platform-specific implementation separately

A valid experiment connects one decision to one falsifiable hypothesis. A completed experiment becomes durable knowledge only after validity, scope, uncertainty, and transfer limits are recorded.

## Minimum pre-test specification

- Problem and evidence
- Prior relevant learning
- Hypothesis and expected mechanism
- Control and variant
- Population and allocation
- Primary metric and business guardrails
- Required evidence level
- Instrumentation and QA
- Minimum practical effect or decision threshold
- Duration covering relevant cycles and conversion lag
- Stop conditions for harm or invalid data
- Decision rule: ship, iterate, reject, or inconclusive

Avoid repeated peeking, changing several major variables without accepting ambiguity, or declaring a winner from directional noise.

## Post-test learning sequence

1. **Validate execution before direction.** Confirm allocation, treatment fidelity, instrumentation, lag, contamination, duration/sample, and stop-rule adherence.
2. **Classify the result.** Valid-supports, valid-contradicts, valid-inconclusive/null, valid-guardrail-harm, or invalid/compromised.
3. **Record the estimate and uncertainty.** Preserve the primary business outcome, guardrails, decision threshold or MDE, and achieved evidence level.
4. **Separate observation from mechanism.** The measured treatment effect can be valid even when the explanation for it remains an inference.
5. **Make the scoped decision.** Ship, reject, iterate, replicate, collect more data, invalidate/rerun, or stop for harm.
6. **Create a learning record.** Preserve population, surface, geography, period, offer/commercial conditions, platform/product state, contradictions, and what the result does not prove.
7. **Assign transfer status.** Local result → replication candidate → replicated scoped pattern. Conflicting evidence becomes contradicted/unstable rather than being erased.
8. **Generate the next hypothesis only when it resolves valuable uncertainty.** Experiment count and win rate are not objectives by themselves.

A single valid test may support a local implementation when the decision rule and authorization allow it. It does not establish a universal best practice. Post-hoc segment cuts, external case studies, competitor examples, and platform benchmarks are hypothesis inputs unless independently validated in the relevant scope.

Use `templates/experiment.md` (source: `templates/experiment.md`) before launch and `templates/experiment-learning.md` (source: `templates/experiment-learning.md`) after conclusion. Detailed knowledge-promotion rules live under `$tracking-measurement` in `references/experiment-learning-system.md`.

# Google Ads Full Stack Framework

## Process
Business Economics → Research → ICP → Search Intent → Keyword Strategy → Campaign Architecture → Ad Messaging → Landing Page → Conversion Tracking → Bidding → Optimization → Offline Feedback → Scaling

## Audit Areas
- Account structure
- Search terms and keyword quality
- Match types and negatives
- Ad relevance
- Landing page alignment
- Conversion tracking integrity
- Bid strategy suitability
- Profitability and margins

## Principle
Optimize for business outcomes, not platform metrics alone.

## Source: `frameworks/marginal-economics.md`

# Marginal Economics Framework

## Knowledge metadata

- Primary type: model
- Secondary type: framework / decision rule
- Decision: whether the next unit of spend creates acceptable business value
- Evidence status: calculated from verified scoped inputs
- Freshness: refresh with economics, mix, and conversion maturity

Report total/blended and change/marginal performance separately. The next unit is scalable only when its expected or observed marginal contribution/qualified value, capacity, risk, and uncertainty meet the defined rule.

Show formulas, revenue/cost basis, lag, comparison, confidence/sensitivity, cannibalization, operational cost, and opportunity cost. Attribution is not incrementality; a platform forecast is not observed marginal performance. Missing costs produce a range or unknown, not a profitability verdict.

## Source: `frameworks/measurement-and-evidence.md`

# Measurement and Evidence Framework

## Knowledge metadata

- Primary type: framework
- Secondary type: model / standard
- Decision: whether evidence supports a marketing decision
- Evidence status: stable operating method
- Freshness: stable; metric definitions remain client-specific

## Claim levels

- **Observed:** directly present in a named source and scope.
- **Calculated:** derived with visible formula and inputs.
- **Inferred:** a supported explanation that has not been isolated.
- **Assumed:** needed to proceed and explicitly unverified.
- **Unknown:** missing and potentially decision-changing.

Platform attribution is a model, not a ledger. Reconcile it with storefront, CRM, payment, fulfillment, refund, and cost data according to the decision.

Use the definitions in `GLOSSARY.md` (source: `GLOSSARY.md`). Attribution assigns credit; reconciliation explains differences; incrementality estimates additional outcomes caused; none of these terms is interchangeable.

## Commercial outcomes

Use the furthest trustworthy outcome: contribution profit at a named level, realized revenue, qualified pipeline, closed-won revenue, retention, or another verified business result. If only proxy metrics exist, state the limitation.

## Confidence

Confidence rises with directness, consistency across independent sources, adequate sample, stable definitions, and a plausible mechanism. It falls with attribution overlap, small samples, reporting lag, selection bias, or simultaneous changes.

# Meta Ads Full Stack Framework

## Purpose
A decision system for planning, launching, testing, optimizing, and scaling Meta Ads.

## Process
Research → ICP → Awareness → Offer → Funnel Stage → Audience → Creative Angle → Hook → Format → Copy → Campaign Structure → Tracking → Testing → Optimization → Scaling → Retention

## Core Areas
- Market and customer research
- Customer pain points and desired outcomes
- Creative testing strategy
- Campaign architecture
- Pixel, CAPI, and attribution checks
- Budget allocation
- Performance diagnosis

## Optimization Questions
- Is the problem traffic, conversion, offer, creative, or measurement?
- What evidence supports the change?
- What test will create the most learning?

## Source: `frameworks/portfolio-allocation.md`

# Portfolio Allocation Framework

## Knowledge metadata

- Primary type: framework
- Secondary type: model / strategy
- Decision: where the next unit of marketing budget should go
- Evidence status: account-current analytical decision
- Freshness: refresh with marginal evidence and capacity

Evaluate each entity on marginal business-value potential, evidence strength, demand opportunity, measurement integrity, capacity, reversibility, time to learn, cannibalization, strategic importance, creative supply, opportunity cost, and maximum downside.

Classify: `protect`, `maintain`, `diagnostic-test`, `increase`, `expand`, `hold`, `reduce`, `exit`, or `recovery-watch`.

Do not allocate solely by blended platform ROAS or sum overlapping attribution. Protect valuable branded/strategic coverage and retain a stable comparison when it materially improves learning.

## Source: `frameworks/scale-readiness.md`

# Scale Readiness Framework

## Knowledge metadata

- Primary type: framework
- Secondary type: checklist / decision rule
- Decision: whether and how campaign scaling may be tested
- Evidence status: stable operating method
- Freshness: stable; account/platform details require current verification

Assess nine gates: business outcome, measurement, economics, stability, opportunity, creative, funnel, operations, and risk/authorization.

Return pass, fail, or decision-changing unknown for each. Do not average away a critical failure. Measurement, economics, legal/policy, capacity, or authorization failures block live scaling.

Verdicts: `not-ready-blocked`, `not-ready-unknown`, `diagnostic-test-ready`, `limited-test-ready`, `controlled-scale-ready`, `portfolio-expansion-ready`, `hold`, `rollback-required`, `de-scale-required`, or `recovery-verification`.

## Source: `frameworks/scaling-mode-selector.md`

# Scaling Mode Selector

## Knowledge metadata

- Primary type: framework
- Secondary type: strategy selector
- Decision: which form of scaling addresses the binding constraint
- Evidence status: decision method
- Freshness: stable; channel controls require current verification

Modes: vertical budget, bid-target, horizontal demand, creative, product/service, market, funnel, value, portfolio, operational, structural, and de-scaling/recovery.

Require for each candidate: mechanism, opportunity, economics, evidence, downside, reversibility, time to learn, capacity, protected coverage, and authorization. Prefer the smallest interpretable mode with acceptable expected value. A tactic such as raising budget is not the strategy.

## Source: `frameworks/scaling-proof-standard.md`

# Scaling Proof Standard

## Knowledge metadata

- Primary type: standard
- Secondary type: framework / evidence model
- Decision: what may be called proven and scalable
- Evidence status: operating contract
- Freshness: stable; platform capability evidence remains current-source gated

Use levels S0–S7: unverified, officially documented, account-visible, analytically supported, experimentally validated, business-verified, replicated, and currently scalable.

A claim earns only the highest level directly supported. “Proven” is scoped to the named account, outcome definition, market/entity, period, experiment or comparison, and guardrails. Statistical or platform success without a verified business result is insufficient. Higher downside requires stronger design, replication, and containment.

Never convert a forecast, recommendation, attribution model, case study, or documented capability into guaranteed client impact.

# Cross-Channel Diagnostic Playbook

## Knowledge metadata

- Primary type: playbook
- Secondary type: process / methodology
- Decision: why a cross-channel business outcome changed
- Evidence status: repeatable diagnostic method; account evidence required
- Freshness: stable; platform details require current-source checks

Use when a business outcome changes across more than one platform.

1. Anchor on the business source of truth and one consistent timezone.
2. Check measurement, site availability, inventory, promotions, and operational incidents before attributing the change to media.
3. Decompose demand, traffic mix, auction cost, response, conversion, AOV or lead quality, and margin.
4. Reconcile platform totals without summing overlapping attribution as incremental revenue.
5. Rank channel and non-channel causes, then choose the next data cut or reversible test that best distinguishes them.

# Cross-Channel Scaling Playbook

## Knowledge metadata

- Primary type: playbook
- Secondary type: portfolio strategy / process
- Decision: where the next unit of budget creates the best verified business value
- Evidence status: source-reconciled account evidence required
- Freshness: account-current

1. Align source of truth, definitions, timezone, currency, cohort, lag, and cost scope.
2. Reconcile platforms without adding overlapping attributed revenue.
3. Separate demand creation/capture, brand/non-brand, acquisition/retention, and new/returning customer roles.
4. Estimate marginal opportunity, capacity, cannibalization, evidence strength, time to learn, and downside by candidate.
5. Protect strategically necessary coverage and stable comparisons.
6. Choose one bounded reallocation or expansion hypothesis with approval and rollback.
7. Evaluate business-source contribution or qualified pipeline, mix shifts, downstream quality, and channel interaction.
8. Continue, hold, reverse, or switch constraint/mode; do not crown a platform from blended ROAS.

## Source: `playbooks/de-scaling-recovery.md`

# De-scaling and Recovery Playbook

## Knowledge metadata

- Primary type: playbook
- Secondary type: containment / recovery process
- Decision: how to reduce exposure and verify recovery without destroying valuable coverage
- Evidence status: breach and recovery evidence required
- Freshness: incident-current

1. Identify the breached financial, quality, delivery, operations, measurement, policy, or capacity guardrail.
2. Separate measurement invalidity from genuine business harm.
3. Contain the smallest affected entity while preserving evidence and protected coverage.
4. Execute only the approved rollback or de-scaling step; document prior/current state.
5. Reconcile the business source of truth through the relevant lag/recovery window.
6. Decide `recovered`, `partially recovered`, `not recovered`, `new root cause`, or `insufficient evidence`.
7. Resume only after the failed readiness gate is restored and a new bounded plan is approved.

# Ecommerce Playbook

## Knowledge metadata

- Primary type: playbook
- Secondary type: process / model
- Decision: how to diagnose and improve ecommerce contribution
- Evidence status: repeatable operating method; economics must be defined
- Freshness: stable; platform controls require current-source checks

1. Establish product, market, inventory, price, promotion, shipping, and return context.
2. Reconcile sessions, orders, revenue, discounts, refunds, taxes, COGS, fulfillment, fees, and media spend.
3. Diagnose by product and contribution, not blended ROAS alone.
4. Protect profitable branded demand and commercially important product coverage.
5. Test offer, creative, traffic, page, and merchandising hypotheses with AOV, refund, and margin guardrails.

Core equation:

If the source begins with gross sales:

`Contribution profit after media = gross sales - discounts - refunds - COGS - variable fulfillment - payment fees - media spend`

If the source begins with net revenue that already reflects discounts and refunds:

`Contribution profit after media = net revenue - COGS - variable fulfillment - payment fees - media spend`

Never subtract discounts or refunds twice. If an input is missing, provide a break-even table or sensitivity range rather than a false profitability verdict. Do not call the result operating profit when fixed operating expenses are unavailable.

- Primary type: playbook
- Secondary type: process / model
- Decision: how to optimize for qualified pipeline and realized value
- Evidence status: repeatable operating method; CRM definitions are client-specific
- Freshness: stable; lifecycle and platform labels require explicit mapping

1. Define a qualified lead, disqualifiers, sales capacity, response-time expectation, close stages, and realized value.
2. Join ad and form data to CRM outcomes where possible.
3. Diagnose volume, contact rate, qualification, appointment, show, close, and revenue separately.
4. Optimize to the deepest reliable signal; protect lead quality with offline feedback and sales notes.
5. Test targeting, message, form friction, qualification, routing, and follow-up without disguising low-quality volume as growth.

Core equation:

`Expected lead value = qualification rate × close rate × realized customer value`

Report cost per qualified lead and customer acquisition cost when data permits, not CPL alone.

Map the client's actual CRM stages before comparing results. A common reference sequence is:

`inquiry -> lead -> contacted lead -> qualified lead -> sales-qualified opportunity -> appointment or proposal -> closed-won customer -> realized revenue`

## Source: `workflows/creative-ideation-engine.md`

# Creative Ideation Engine Workflow

## Goal

Turn verified customer, product, offer, and performance evidence into a prioritized set of strategically distinct creative experiments.

Owner: `$creative-strategy`.

This workflow generates hypotheses and test cells. It does not prove that an angle, mechanic, hook, or format will work, publish ads, or replace customer research.

## Inputs

- product truth and claims boundaries
- target audience and situation
- verified customer language or clearly labeled research gaps
- pain, desire, or JTBD
- awareness stage or best-supported awareness hypothesis
- objections and current beliefs
- differentiators and offer
- available proof
- brand and placement constraints
- prior creative or performance learning when available

When reviews are a material source, use the `$customer-research` review-mining handoff rather than selecting flattering quotes directly.

## Process

1. **Verify the source insight.** Separate observed evidence, supplied facts, inference, assumptions, and unknowns.
2. **Map the audience state.** Use the awareness-belief-desire map to state the situation, desired progress, current belief, blocking belief, required belief shift, and available proof.
3. **Form angle hypotheses.** Create distinct reasons to care that connect the audience's desired progress to substantiated product or offer truth.
4. **Expand deliberately.** Use the ideation expansion method to generate evidence-compatible mechanic, concept, hook, visual-format, proof, and CTA candidates without forcing an idea quota.
5. **Choose the meaning-making structure.** Select a primary creative mechanic that defines how the concept will make the angle land: demonstrate, compare, reframe, reveal, teach, provide proof, or another supportable route.
6. **Build the execution.** Turn the mechanic into a specific concept, write the opening with the hook-execution method, and choose visual-format candidates that serve the mechanic and proof requirements.
7. **Remove duplicates.** Consolidate cosmetic variations and any cells that would teach the same strategic lesson.
8. **Prioritize.** Rank by evidence fit, business relevance, differentiation, proof availability, production feasibility, and learning value.
9. **Build the matrix.** Record each selected cell in `templates/creative-idea-matrix.md` (source: `templates/creative-idea-matrix.md`).
10. **Define the test.** Name the controlled variable, success signal, business guardrail, decision window, and what a win, loss, or inconclusive result would teach.
11. **Create production briefs.** Convert approved cells into the creative brief or static DTC render brief owned by `$creative-strategy`.
12. **Validate platform fit.** Route current platform-native fit and policy-sensitive execution to the owning channel skill before launch.
13. **Hand off to testing.** Use `creative-testing.md` (source: `workflows/creative-testing.md`) for launch, analysis, learning extraction, and iteration.

## Canonical reasoning flow

```text
Verified research
→ audience situation
→ pain / desire / JTBD
→ awareness
→ current belief
→ required belief shift
→ angle
→ creative mechanic
→ concept
→ hook
→ visual format
→ proof
→ CTA
→ test hypothesis
```

The flow is a reasoning aid, not a claim that buyers move through these states linearly.

## Decision rules

- Do not generate a belief shift that the available evidence cannot support.
- Do not treat awareness labels as facts when they are inferred from limited evidence.
- An angle changes the strategic reason to care; a mechanic changes how the audience reaches that reason; a hook changes how the concept opens; a format changes the delivery vessel.
- Do not treat a format family, mechanic family, hook tactic, or voice pattern as inherently high-performing.
- More ideas are not automatically better. Stop expansion when additional cells become cosmetic, weakly evidenced, or low-learning.
- Prior performance can inform prioritization but does not make a new execution proven.
- A generated idea remains a hypothesis until the relevant test produces interpretable evidence.

## Output

A prioritized creative idea matrix containing:

- source insight and evidence state
- audience situation
- pain/desire/JTBD
- awareness
- current and blocking belief
- required belief shift
- angle and hypothesis
- primary creative mechanic
- concept
- hook
- visual format
- proof
- offer/CTA
- controlled variable
- success signal
- business guardrail
- decision window
- expected learning
- status

## QA

Check that the source insight is grounded, review evidence is not selectively sampled, belief shifts are supportable, angles are strategically distinct, mechanics have a clear communication job, hooks preserve the angle and proof boundary, formats serve the mechanic rather than replace strategy, duplicate cells are removed, current platform fit is validated by the correct owner, and each selected test can teach something useful regardless of whether it wins.

# Marketing Decision Lifecycle

## Knowledge metadata

- Primary type: workflow / process
- Decision: how a marketing request moves from decision context to verified learning without duplicating specialist ownership
- Orchestration owner: `$marketing-router`
- Specialist ownership: retained by the skill that owns each substantive decision
- Evidence status: stable operating method; each stage inherits the evidence quality of its sources and specialist artifacts
- Authorization: read-only by default; this workflow never authorizes a live mutation by itself

## Canonical lifecycle

`CONTEXT → GOAL → STRATEGY → PLAN → EXECUTE → REVIEW → OPTIMIZE ↺`

This is a state model, not a mandatory seven-step checklist. Start at the earliest unresolved stage that can materially change the requested decision. Skip stages already satisfied by current evidence, an approved artifact, or the user's bounded request. Re-enter an earlier stage when new evidence invalidates an assumption, changes the business objective, or supersedes the strategy.

The lifecycle coordinates existing Marketing OS owners. It does **not** create separate `context`, `goal`, `strategy`, `plan`, `execute`, `review`, or `optimize` skills.

Runtimes or interfaces may expose labels such as `/context`, `/goal`, `/strategy`, `/plan`, `/execute`, `/review`, and `/optimize` as convenience aliases. Those labels must route to the governed owners below rather than become a competing instruction layer.

## Stage map

| Stage | Core question | Default ownership | Exit condition |
|---|---|---|---|
| `context` | What do we know, how do we know it, and what is missing? | `$marketing-intake` when evidence, definitions, economics, scope, or authorization are materially unclear | Decision-relevant context is sufficient for the next decision, or remaining gaps are explicitly labeled and safe to carry |
| `goal` | What outcome or decision must change? | `$growth-strategy` for business-level objective framing; the domain owner for an already-bounded specialist objective | Outcome, scope, baseline/desired direction where relevant, horizon, and guardrails are explicit enough to govern the work |
| `strategy` | Where will we focus and why? | `$growth-strategy` for integrated business direction; the specialist owner for domain strategy | Strategic choice, mechanism/hypothesis, non-priorities or boundaries, and evidence state are explicit |
| `plan` | Who does what, in what order, with what dependencies and decision rules? | `$marketing-router` coordinates decomposition; specialist skills own their workstream decisions | Owners, sequence/dependencies, required artifacts, measurement, and approval boundaries are clear enough to act |
| `execute` | What work should be created, configured, published, or changed now? | Owning specialist plus the actually available authorized runtime/tool | Intended action is completed to an exact implementation state and verification requirement is recorded |
| `review` | What actually happened relative to the goal and guardrails? | Domain owner, `$performance-diagnostics`, `$tracking-measurement`, `$marketing-reporting`, or `$growth-strategy` according to the decision | Evidence is mature enough to support a bounded decision, or review remains explicitly pending/blocked |
| `optimize` | What should change next given the learning? | Domain owner; `$optimization-scaling` for paid-media scale/de-scale and allocation decisions | Continue, hold, revise, kill, reprioritize, or route to scaling is decided and the next lifecycle stage is named when useful |

## Stage detection

1. Identify the requested deliverable or decision and the current implementation state.
2. Check whether decision-relevant context already exists in the request, current Marketing Context, specialist artifacts, or source systems.
3. Identify the **earliest unresolved lifecycle stage that can reverse the requested decision**. That is the current stage.
4. Do not restart at `context` merely because the workflow begins there. A simple bounded rewrite can begin at `execute`; a performance drop can begin at `review`; a proven paid-media expansion request can begin at `optimize`.
5. Do not skip a blocking earlier stage. Missing profitability inputs may force a scaling request back to `context`; an undefined business objective may block an integrated strategy; an unapproved live mutation may block `execute` even when the plan is complete.
6. Route the current stage to one primary owner and only the supporting owners needed for distinct dependencies.
7. Record the next decision point only when it helps continuation. Do not manufacture a future stage for a task that is complete.

## Stage contracts

### 1. Context

Use `$marketing-intake` when scope, provenance, economics, metric definitions, source of truth, access, or authorization could change the decision.

Minimum output when context is active:

- primary business outcome or bounded task objective if known
- scope and relevant period
- source/evidence state
- decision-relevant economics and constraints when applicable
- unknowns/contradictions capable of reversing the decision
- authorization boundary
- exact context status: `sufficient`, `partial`, or `blocked`

A lightweight task does not require a formal intake artifact when the request itself supplies enough safe context.

### 2. Goal

For integrated growth work, `$growth-strategy` owns the primary business outcome, baseline, horizon, economic boundary, quality guardrails, and supplied target or desired direction. Do not invent a target merely to fill the stage.

For bounded specialist work, preserve the already-supplied objective instead of escalating every task into business-level strategy.

A valid goal controls downstream trade-offs. A local proxy such as CTR, CPC, engagement, activation rate, or ROAS must not silently replace the actual business outcome when that outcome is observable.

### 3. Strategy

Strategy is a choice, not a task list.

For business-level work, `$growth-strategy` owns the constraint structure, opportunity set, strategic bets, non-priorities, sequence, and learning agenda. For a bounded domain strategy, the relevant specialist owns the technical or commercial decision inside its scope.

Record:

- chosen direction
- evidence/mechanism supporting it
- material alternatives or non-priorities
- what would change the choice
- owner and status

### 4. Plan

Planning decomposes an approved or decision-ready direction into owned workstreams. `$marketing-router` coordinates only when multiple owners are needed.

A useful plan names:

- workstream and specialist owner
- deliverable/decision
- dependency and sequence
- evidence/measurement requirement
- approval or live-mutation boundary
- stopping/review rule where relevant

The plan never transfers decision authority from a specialist to the router or growth strategy.

### 5. Execute

Execution routes to the owning specialist and the actually available tool/runtime. Before material live mutation, validate the action, scope, downside, rollback/stop condition, and authorization.

Use exact implementation states rather than a generic `done`:

`draft → saved/configured → published → live → processing → verified`

Not every artifact uses every state. Never infer a later state from an earlier one.

### 6. Review

Review compares mature evidence with the goal and guardrails.

Common owners:

- metric/business anomaly → `$performance-diagnostics`
- experiment validity, attribution, or causal learning → `$tracking-measurement`
- single-domain outcome → the domain owner
- cross-channel stakeholder synthesis → `$marketing-reporting`
- integrated strategy progress or reprioritization → `$growth-strategy`

Separate observed results from mechanism interpretation. A channel metric can diagnose a system without becoming the business success criterion.

### 7. Optimize

Optimization is a new decision made from review evidence, not a synonym for “make the number better.”

Possible outcomes:

- `continue`
- `hold`
- `revise`
- `kill`
- `reprioritize`
- `route to scaling`

The domain owner handles ordinary optimization inside its scope. `$optimization-scaling` owns paid-media scale readiness, marginal economics, controlled allocation/coverage expansion, de-scaling, and rollback. A fixed percentage budget increase is not a lifecycle rule.

Optimization may return to any earlier stage:

- new evidence invalidates product/customer truth → `context`
- business priority changes → `goal` or `strategy`
- strategy stands but work decomposition changes → `plan`
- approved next iteration is ready → `execute`
- more mature evidence is required → `review`

## Decision record

Use `templates/marketing-decision-record.md` (source: `templates/marketing-decision-record.md`) when continuity across agents, sessions, or several lifecycle stages matters. Do not create one for every tiny task.

The record stores lifecycle state and links to specialist artifacts; it does not replace Marketing Context, strategy records, experiment records, campaign artifacts, or other specialist-owned sources.

## Relationship to Marketing Operations

This lifecycle governs the state of a bounded marketing decision or initiative. `marketing-operations-loop.md` (source: `workflows/marketing-operations-loop.md`) governs **recurring** execution with cadence/triggers, checkpoints, idempotency, approval reuse, alerts, escalation, and runtime verification.

A recurring loop may invoke this lifecycle during a run, but the two are not interchangeable:

- decision lifecycle: where this decision currently is
- operations loop: how repeated runs are safely triggered and coordinated

## Examples

### New business growth plan

`context → goal → strategy → plan`

Execution begins only after the relevant workstream decisions and approvals are ready.

### Existing account performance drop

`review → optimize → execute → review`

Do not rebuild the business strategy unless the evidence shows the prior objective or strategic assumptions no longer hold.

### Approved creative production task

`execute → review`

If the concept and evidence are already approved, do not force new intake or growth strategy.

### Simple copy rewrite

`execute`

The request itself can satisfy context, goal, strategy, and plan when the wording change is bounded and safe.

### Profitable campaign asking for more budget

`optimize`

Route to `$optimization-scaling`; if economics or source-of-truth evidence are missing, step back to `context` before a scale decision.

## QA

A valid lifecycle decision names the current stage only when useful, starts at the earliest **materially unresolved** stage rather than blindly at `context`, preserves one primary owner, does not create duplicate lifecycle skills, does not confuse strategy with planning or planning with execution, preserves exact implementation state, requires authorization before live mutation, evaluates results against the relevant business outcome and guardrails, routes paid-media scaling to `$optimization-scaling`, and allows learning to move the work backward or forward without rewriting history.

## Source: `workflows/marketing-operations-loop.md`

# Marketing Operations Loop

## Knowledge metadata

- Primary type: workflow / process
- Decision: how recurring marketing work moves safely from trigger to verified outcome
- Owner: `$marketing-operations`
- Evidence status: stable operating method; each run inherits the evidence quality of its sources and specialist decisions
- Authorization: read-only by default; mutating steps require explicit valid approval

## Canonical sequence

`Trigger → Load checkpoint → Validate sources/freshness → Route specialist checks → Diagnose/decide → Approval gate → Execute or hand off → Verify implementation → Record state → Record learning/context → Notify/escalate/no-op → Schedule/await next trigger`

Not every loop needs every step. Omissions must be deliberate and justified.

## Step 1 — Trigger

Identify why this run exists:

- fixed cadence
- verified event
- condition-watch check
- verified state change

Record trigger time, trigger source, relevant entity/window, and dedupe key.

## Step 2 — Load checkpoint

Read the last durable state before collecting new evidence. Determine:

- last completed run
- last processed entity/window
- unresolved prior action
- prior alert state
- approval state/expiry
- pending verification

If state cannot determine whether a prior mutation occurred, stop the mutating path and verify/escalate.

## Step 3 — Validate sources and freshness

Check only the evidence needed for the recurring decision. Confirm:

- source available
- metric/definition unchanged or disclosed
- data sufficiently mature for the decision
- shared Marketing Context fields used are current enough
- platform-specific claims pass freshness requirements

A stale input can downgrade the run to read-only or block it entirely.

## Step 4 — Route specialist checks

`$marketing-operations` coordinates. The domain owner still decides.

Examples:

- Google Ads health/optimization → `$google-ads`
- Meta delivery → `$meta-ads`
- cross-channel anomaly → `$performance-diagnostics`
- offer review → `$offer-strategy`
- creative fatigue/iteration → `$creative-strategy`
- landing/page issue → `$cro`
- experiment validity/learning → `$tracking-measurement`
- scaling/pacing → `$optimization-scaling`
- recurring executive communication → `$marketing-reporting`

Use the smallest useful specialist set.

## Step 5 — Diagnose or decide

State:

- current evidence
- domain owner's decision
- confidence/evidence state
- whether action is needed
- no-op reason if not

“No action” is a valid result when the evidence does not justify intervention.

## Step 6 — Approval gate

Before any live mutation, confirm authorization covers:

- exact action type
- entity/scope
- quantitative bounds if relevant
- current conditions
- expiry
- stop/rollback rule

If not, emit an approval request and stop the mutating path.

## Step 7 — Execute or hand off

Only the authorized runtime/domain owner performs the live mutation. Record:

- intended action
- submitted/saved/live status
- execution identifier if available
- timestamp
- expected verification source

A written loop workflow does not itself constitute execution.

## Step 8 — Verify implementation

Confirm the source system reflects the intended change. Distinguish:

- submitted/saved
- live/processing
- observed
- verified

If business impact requires a later observation window, create a pending-verification state rather than claiming success.

## Step 9 — Record state

Persist the checkpoint, dedupe key, decision, authorization used, action state, verification state, and unresolved items.

Do not overwrite failed/skipped history.

## Step 10 — Record learning/context

- validated experiment learning → `$tracking-measurement`
- reusable context change → `$marketing-intake`
- specialist-specific operational pattern → owning skill

Repeated observation alone is not causal proof.

## Step 11 — Output policy

Emit exactly what the loop contract requires:

- alert
- approval request
- decision summary
- recurring report handoff
- escalation
- no output when nothing materially changed

Avoid duplicate alerts by using condition state and re-arm rules.

## Step 12 — Continue, pause, or retire

End each run with one explicit status:

- next run eligible normally
- waiting for data maturity
- waiting for approval
- waiting for verification
- degraded / retryable
- paused / escalated
- retired

## Example loop shapes

### Paid-media review loop

`Weekly trigger → validate cost/revenue windows → channel audit → performance diagnosis if anomaly → pacing/scaling decision if eligible → approval if mutation → execute → verify → log decision/learning`

### Creative learning loop

`New creative data window → validate sample → creative-strategy read → identify fatigue/winner hypothesis → tracking-measurement learning status → draft next controlled test → no live launch without channel approval`

### Conversion loop

`Page-change/event trigger → verify deployment → wait for valid observation window → CRO review → experiment learning → keep/iterate/revert decision → log context`

### Condition-watch loop

`Scheduled check → read current condition + prior alert state → validate persistence/window → if unchanged false: no output → if newly true: route specialist → alert/approval request → set notified state → re-arm only after reset rule`

## QA

A valid loop has a justified trigger, durable checkpoint, source/freshness gate, domain owner for each substantive decision, idempotency for repeated effects, approval before mutation, implementation verification, bounded output policy, explicit escalation/stop behavior, and exact runtime status.

## Distinction Check

For each pair of cells that look similar, answer:

- What different strategic reason to care is being tested?
- Is the audience reaching the point through a different mechanic, or only seeing a different surface treatment?
- What different belief, objection, motivation, proof job, opening, or format assumption is being tested?
- If one wins and the other loses, what would we learn?

If there is no meaningful difference, consolidate the cells.

## Execution Check

For each selected cell:

- Does the mechanic have one clear communication job?
- Does the concept express that mechanic rather than merely naming a format?
- Does the hook preserve the angle and proof boundary?
- Does the visual format serve the mechanic and product truth?
- Are any customer words traceable rather than synthesized and mislabeled as VOC?
- Are current platform-fit or policy questions routed to the correct channel owner?

## Prioritization

Rate or rank selected cells using evidence fit, business relevance, differentiation, proof availability, production feasibility, and learning value. Do not convert the ranking into a prediction that a cell will win.

## Approval and Handoff

- Cells approved for production:
- Cells held for missing evidence:
- Cells rejected as duplicates or weak hypotheses:
- Production brief owner:
- Platform-fit owner:
- Test owner:
- Approval status:

A matrix cell is a hypothesis until tested. Keep draft, approved, produced, published, live, and verified states distinct.

## Content

Describe the artifact, its intended use, limitations, and the evidence or source that supports it.

## QA

- Primary type is explicit and secondary types are justified.
- Patterns are not written as causal conclusions.
- Models expose variables and assumptions.
- Best practices and heuristics have scope, freshness, and override conditions.
- Tactics include approval and rollback/stop conditions when they could affect live systems.
- Status matches verification: draft, approved, implemented, processing, or live-verified.

# Marketing Context

Shared decision context for the Marketing OS.

Owner: `$marketing-intake`.

This artifact reduces repeated intake across skills. It is a curated context layer, not a replacement for source evidence, the evidence register, or specialist analysis. Every decision-relevant statement must preserve its source and evidence state. Unknowns remain unknown; contradictions remain visible.

## Document State

- Scope / business:
- Status: draft | partial | current | stale

| Market / geography |  |  |  |
| Time horizon |  |  |  |
| Strategic constraints |  |  |  |

## Growth Strategy State

Record this section when an integrated business-level growth strategy is decision-relevant. `$growth-strategy` owns the current constraint structure, opportunity portfolio, strategic priorities, non-priorities, sequencing, and review state. Specialist source artifacts still govern the underlying decisions.

| Field | Current context | Source | Evidence state |
|---|---|---|---|
| Strategy version / status |  |  |  |
| Planning horizon |  |  |  |
| Constraint structure | primary/binding / co-limiting-interacting / independent / not yet identified |  |  |
| Current limiting constraint(s) |  |  |  |
| Constraint confidence / evidence state |  |  |  |
| Priority strategic bets |  |  |  |
| Explicit non-priorities |  |  |  |
| Key dependencies / capacity limits |  |  |  |
| Learning agenda / major open hypothesis |  |  |  |
| Next review trigger / decision point |  |  |  |

## Product Truth and Claim Boundaries

| Field | Current context | Source | Evidence state |
|---|---|---|---|
| Product / service |  |  |  |
| Core use case |  |  |  |
| Verified capabilities |  |  |  |
| Claim boundaries |  |  |  |
| Known limitations |  |  |  |

## Market, Segment, and JTBD

| Field | Current context | Source | Evidence state |
|---|---|---|---|
| Category / market frame |  |  |  |
| Priority segment |  |  |  |
| Secondary / experimental segment |  |  |  |
| Buying situation |  |  |  |
| JTBD / desired progress |  |  |  |
| Buyer / user roles |  |  |  |
| Exclusions / poor-fit segment |  |  |  |

## Customer Evidence and VOC

Record patterns here; keep traceable quotations in the underlying research source.

| Field | Current context | Source | Evidence state |
|---|---|---|---|
| Pain / friction |  |  |  |
| Desired outcome |  |  |  |
| Trigger moments |  |  |  |
| Objections / anxieties |  |  |  |
| Selection criteria |  |  |  |
| Repeated language / themes |  |  |  |
| Contradictions / segment differences |  |  |  |

## Positioning and Differentiation

| Field | Current context | Source | Evidence state |
|---|---|---|---|
| Positioning hypothesis / decision |  |  |  |
| Differentiators |  |  |  |
| Reason to believe |  |  |  |
| Alternatives / status quo |  |  |  |
| Competitor implications |  |  |  |

## Current Offer

This section records the current offer state. `$offer-strategy` owns diagnosis or redesign of the proposition itself.

| Field | Current context | Source | Evidence state |
|---|---|---|---|
| Core deliverable |  |  |  |
| Promised outcome |  |  |  |
| Offer components / bundle |  |  |  |
| Risk reversal |  |  |  |
| Real urgency / scarcity |  |  |  |

## Current Pricing and Monetization

This section records the current commercial exchange state. `$pricing-monetization` owns pricing architecture and price-change decisions. Preserve exact state: proposed, approved, configured, live, observed, or verified.

| Field | Current context | Source | Evidence state |
|---|---|---|---|
| Base / list price |  |  |  |
| Realized price / discount mix |  |  |  |
| Value metric |  |  |  |
| Packages / tiers |  |  |  |
| Payment model / terms |  |  |  |
| Fees / credits |  |  |  |
| Existing-customer / renewal treatment |  |  |  |
| Commercial state |  |  |  |

## Activation and First Value

Record this section only when a distinct post-conversion activation stage is decision-relevant. `$activation` owns the first meaningful value definition, path-to-value, time-to-value, and activation diagnosis. Do not invent an activation event just to fill the template.

| Field | Current context | Source | Evidence state |
|---|---|---|---|
| Conversion boundary |  |  |  |
| Distinct activation stage exists? |  |  |  |
| First meaningful value definition |  |  |  |

| Time-to-value baseline |  |  |  |
| First binding barrier |  |  |  |
| Instrumentation state |  |  |  |
| Current intervention / test state |  |  |  |

## Retention Strategy State

Record this section only when repeat, renewal, continuing use/service, lapse, recovery, or win-back is decision-relevant. `$retention-strategy` owns reason diagnosis and intervention strategy; `$retention-economics` owns realized retention/LTV/payback evidence.

| Field | Current context | Source | Evidence state |
|---|---|---|---|
| Continuation behavior |  |  |  |
| Relevant segment / cohort / window |  |  |  |
| Observed state | active / at risk / voluntary cancel / involuntary loss / dormant-lapsed / recovered / won back |  |  |
| Leading reason family |  |  |  |
| Reason confidence |  |  |  |
| Voluntary / involuntary / lapse classification |  |  |  |
| Current intervention hypothesis |  |  |  |
| Root-cause owner |  |  |  |
| Current test / rollout state |  |  |  |
| Durable-save / recovery verification state |  |  |  |

## Proof Inventory

| Proof type | Available evidence | Source | Evidence state | Allowed use / limit |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Product demonstration |  |  |  |  |
| Customer-reported experience |  |  |  |  |
| Case study / business result |  |  |  |  |
| Independent / third-party proof |  |  |  |  |
| Credentials / authority |  |  |  |  |

## Economics and Commercial Constraints

## Change Log

Newest first. Preserve prior entries rather than rewriting history.

- vX — YYYY-MM-DD — What changed, why, source or decision that changed it.

## Usage Rules

- Downstream skills read only the sections relevant to their decision; this is not a requirement to load the whole file for every trivial task.
- A context entry inherits the evidence state of its underlying source; summarizing it here never upgrades confidence.
- Customer language is not verbatim VOC unless it remains traceable to the supplied source.
- A model-generated synthesis is labeled synthesis or hypothesis, not customer evidence, willingness-to-pay, activation fact, verified retention cause, or a verified growth constraint.
- A growth strategy summary cannot make a specialist hypothesis true; strategy priorities stay tied to the source evidence and may become stale when constraints, economics, capacity, or opportunity cost change.
- Do not force a single binding growth constraint in context. Preserve the current `primary/binding`, `co-limiting/interacting`, `independent`, or `not yet identified` strategy state from the governing strategy artifact.
- A proposed/configured price remains proposed/configured here until the source pricing artifact verifies a later state.
- An activation event remains hypothesis/provisional here until the `$activation` artifact supports a stronger state; onboarding completion or email engagement is not silently promoted to first value.
- A customer-stated cancellation reason remains customer-stated here; it is not silently promoted to verified retention causality. A save remains provisional until the decision-relevant continuation window is observed.
- Do not silently overwrite a contradiction. Record the competing evidence and the segment, date, or source difference.
- Do not place unnecessary personal data in this artifact.
- When a decision materially changes the context, increment the context version and prepend a change-log entry.
- If a decision-relevant section is stale or contradicted, mark the context partial or stale rather than letting downstream skills treat it as current.

# Marketing Decision Record

Owner: `$marketing-router` for lifecycle state only. Every substantive decision remains owned by its governing specialist skill.

Use this record when a marketing initiative needs continuity across multiple lifecycle stages, agents, sessions, or handoffs. Do not create it for a tiny bounded task that can be completed safely in one step.

Canonical lifecycle: `CONTEXT → GOAL → STRATEGY → PLAN → EXECUTE → REVIEW → OPTIMIZE ↺`

See `workflows/marketing-decision-lifecycle.md` (source: `workflows/marketing-decision-lifecycle.md`).

## Record State

- Record ID / initiative:
- Business / account / scope:
- Version:
- Current lifecycle stage: context | goal | strategy | plan | execute | review | optimize
- Stage status: active | blocked | satisfied | complete | superseded
- Primary decision owner:
- Supporting owners:
- Source-of-truth system(s):
- Marketing Context version, if used:
- Last updated:
- Next decision point, if any:

Do not mark a stage complete merely because a document exists. Stage state must reflect the decision and evidence actually available.

## 1. Context

Status: not required | active | partial | sufficient | blocked | superseded

- Primary business outcome or bounded task objective:
- Business model / product / service:
- Market / geography:
- Relevant period / horizon:
- Source systems / artifacts:
- Evidence state:
- Metric / lifecycle definitions that matter:
- Economics / profit level, if decision-relevant:
- Capacity / operational constraints:
- Authorization boundary:
- Contradictions / unknowns capable of reversing the decision:
- Context owner / source artifact:

Do not copy raw evidence that belongs in a specialist artifact or source system. Link or name the source and preserve evidence state.

## 2. Goal

Status: not required | active | decision-ready | approved | superseded

| Field | Decision |
|---|---|
| Outcome / decision to change |  |
| Current baseline, if relevant |  |
| Supplied target / desired direction, if any |  |
| Target evidence state |  |
| Time horizon / decision window |  |
| Economic boundary |  |
| Quality / customer guardrails |  |
| What meaningful progress means |  |
| Goal owner |  |

Do not invent a target or replace the business outcome with a convenient platform metric.

## 3. Strategy

Status: not required | draft | decision-ready | approved | under review | superseded

- Strategic choice / direction:
- Constraint, opportunity, or mechanism it addresses:
- Evidence / confidence:
- Material alternatives considered:
- Explicit non-priorities / boundaries:
- What would change the strategy:
- Strategy owner:
- Source strategy / specialist artifact:

Strategy is the chosen direction and rationale. Keep task lists in the Plan section.

## 4. Plan

Status: not required | draft | decision-ready | approved | in execution | superseded

| Workstream | Specialist owner | Decision / deliverable | Dependency / sequence | Measurement / review rule | Approval boundary | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |

Planning coordinates work; it does not transfer specialist decision ownership.

## 5. Execute

Status: not required | draft | saved/configured | published | live | processing | verified | blocked | superseded

| Action / artifact | Owner / runtime | Intended state | Actual observed state | Verification source | Authorization used | Open issue |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |

Record only implementation states supported by evidence. A recommendation is not execution; a saved configuration is not verified delivery.

## 6. Review

Status: not required | waiting for maturity | active | decision-ready | blocked | complete | superseded

- Review question:
- Observation window / maturity requirement:
- Primary business outcome:
- Guardrails:
- Observed result:
- Supporting metrics:
- Measurement validity / evidence state:
- Competing explanations:
- Mechanism interpretation, kept separate from observation:
- Review owner:
- Source review / experiment / diagnostic artifact:

### Review decision

- continue | hold | revise | kill | reprioritize | route to scaling | insufficient evidence
- Reason:
- What evidence could reverse this decision:

## 7. Optimize

Status: not required | active | decision-ready | approved | executed | blocked | superseded

- Decision from review:
- Change proposed:
- Domain owner:
- If paid-media scaling/de-scaling: `$optimization-scaling` handoff:
- Marginal/economic evidence required:
- Capacity / guardrails:
- Stop / rollback rule:
- Authorization boundary:
- Next lifecycle stage: context | goal | strategy | plan | execute | review | optimize | complete
- Why that next stage is correct:

Optimization may move backward or forward in the lifecycle. Do not force a linear progression when the evidence changes.

## Decision History

Newest first. Preserve prior decisions rather than rewriting them after results arrive.

| Date | From stage | Decision / evidence change | Owner | To stage | State |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|  |  |  |  |  |  |

## Open Decisions

| Decision | Why it matters | Owner | Blocking evidence / dependency | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
|  |  |  |  |  |

## Exact Status

- Current lifecycle stage:
- Current stage status:
- Work actually approved:
- Work actually implemented:
- Work actually verified:
- Open contradiction / blocker:
- Next decision point:

## Usage Rules

- The lifecycle is stateful, not a mandatory checklist.
- Start at the earliest unresolved stage capable of changing the requested decision.
- Skip stages already satisfied by current evidence or a bounded request.
- Use `$marketing-intake` when decision-relevant context is materially unclear.
- Use `$growth-strategy` for integrated business-level objective and strategy decisions; preserve specialist ownership for bounded domain strategy.
- Use `$marketing-router` only to coordinate multi-owner planning and lifecycle state.
- Execution belongs to the owning specialist and an actually available authorized runtime/tool.
- Review must separate observed results from causal/mechanism interpretation.
- Paid-media scale/de-scale and allocation decisions route to `$optimization-scaling`.
- This record does not replace Marketing Context or specialist artifacts and never authorizes a live mutation by itself.

## Learning Handoff

- Experiment learning owner:
- Marketing Context update rule:
- Specialist learning destination:
- What must not be promoted to causal/best-practice status:

## Run Record

For each run preserve:

- run ID/time

- source versions/evidence state
- decisions and owners
- approval used
- action state
- verification state
- output/alert state
- learning/context updates
- errors/skips/escalations
- exact run status

## QA

Confirm trigger/cadence is justified; state is durable; retries cannot duplicate live effects; every substantive decision has a domain owner; source/freshness gates are explicit; live changes cannot bypass authorization; output noise is controlled; stop/escalation/retirement exists; and `active-verified` is used only after an actual expected run has been observed successfully.

# Growth Strategy / Marketing Plan

Owner: `$growth-strategy`.

Use this artifact to record an integrated business-level marketing strategy. It composes specialist decisions; it does not replace their source artifacts or authorize live changes.

## Document State

- Strategy version:
- Business / scope:
- Planning horizon:
- Status: draft | decision-ready | approved | in execution | under review | superseded
- Source-of-truth system(s):
- Marketing Context version:
- Decision owner:
- Approval boundary:

## 1. Business Objective

| Field | Decision |
|---|---|
| Primary business outcome |  |
| Current baseline |  |
| Supplied target / desired direction, if any |  |
| Target evidence state |  |
| Economic level / revenue basis |  |
| Time horizon |  |
| Quality / customer guardrails |  |
| Capacity / cash constraints |  |
| What meaningful progress means |  |

Do not invent a target merely to complete this section. A business-supplied target remains asserted until its feasibility/evidence is established.

## 2. Evidence Baseline

Summarize only decision-relevant evidence. Link the specialist artifact or source rather than copying raw data.

| Area | Current state | Source | Evidence state | Decision implication |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Market / segment / JTBD |  |  |  |  |
| Positioning |  |  |  |  |
| Offer |  |  |  |  |
| Pricing / monetization |  |  |  |  |
| Acquisition |  |  |  |  |
| Conversion |  |  |  |  |
| Activation |  |  |  |  |
| Retention |  |  |  |  |
| Customer economics |  |  |  |  |
| Measurement |  |  |  |  |
| Capacity / operations |  |  |  |  |

### Contradictions / Unknowns

| Item | Why decision-relevant | Owner | Evidence needed |
|---|---|---|---|
|  |  |  |  |

## 3. Current Limiting Constraint(s)

Do not force a single bottleneck. Use the structure the evidence supports.

- Candidate constraints:
- Constraint structure: primary/binding | co-limiting/interacting | independent | not yet identified
- Primary constraint, only if supported:
- Co-limiting / independent constraints, if relevant:
- Evidence classification per constraint: verified blocker | supported constraint | plausible constraint | contradicted | unknown
- Mechanism(s):
- Competing explanations:
- What would change this diagnosis:
- Smallest evidence step if not yet identified:

## 4. Growth Opportunity Set

Do not start with a channel list. Every opportunity must connect to the objective and a plausible constraint, mechanism, or decision-changing uncertainty.

| Opportunity | Constraint / uncertainty link | Mechanism hypothesis | Expected business or learning effect | Evidence / confidence | Specialist owner | Key dependency |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |

## 5. Strategic Bets and Priorities

| Priority / bet | State | Why now | Commercial upside | Effort / capacity | Reversibility / downside | Time to learn | Owner |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|  | protect / priority bet / validate first / maintain / defer / reject |  |  |  |  |  |  |

### Strategic Thesis

State the few choices that define the strategy. Avoid task lists.

- 

## 6. Explicit Non-Priorities

| Not pursuing now | Reason | Reconsider when |
|---|---|---|
|  |  |  |

## 7. Specialist Workstreams

| Strategic bet | Specialist owner | Decision / deliverable needed | Dependency | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
|  |  |  |  |  |

Growth Strategy owns the integrated sequence. Specialists retain their underlying decision authority.

## 8. Learning Agenda / Experiments

| Hypothesis | Test / evidence step | Primary business metric or validated leading indicator | Guardrails | Decision window / maturity | Tracking owner | Decision rule |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |

Do not define success from CTR, attributed revenue, activation rate, retention rate, or another local metric when the business objective or economics can be observed directly.

When the constraint is `not yet identified`, use this section to define the smallest evidence step that can distinguish between major competing constraints before material allocation.

## 9. Sequence and Dependencies

1. Protect / fix:
2. Validate / resolve uncertainty:
3. Execute priority bet:
4. Measure / mature:
5. Continue / hold / revise / kill / reprioritize:
6. Route to scaling when readiness is satisfied:

Do not force this sequence when the evidence supports a different dependency order. Independent workstreams may run in parallel when capacity and interpretability remain acceptable.

## 10. Resource and Capacity Implications

- Budget / cash implication:
- Creative/content capacity:
- Sales/service capacity:
- Inventory/fulfillment capacity:
- Product/engineering/technical dependency:
- Measurement dependency:
- Opportunity cost:

No budget number here authorizes live spend. Paid-media expansion routes to `$optimization-scaling`.

## 11. Review Governance

- Scheduled or condition-based review trigger:
- Earliest meaningful signal window:
- Business-outcome maturity window:
- Conditions for earlier review:
- Constraint-structure change trigger:
- Opportunity-cost / higher-value-alternative trigger:
- `continue` when:
- `hold` when:
- `revise` when:
- `kill` when:
- `reprioritize` when:
- `route to scaling` when:

## 12. Strategy Change Log

Newest first. Do not rewrite history after results arrive.

- vX — YYYY-MM-DD — evidence/change → strategy implication → constraints/priorities added/removed/resequenced.

Record when reprioritization happened because opportunity cost changed even though the original initiative had not failed.

## 13. Exact Status

- Strategy state:
- Constraint structure:
- Approved scope:
- Work actually implemented:
- Work verified:
- Open decisions:
- Next decision point:

## Usage Rules

- A strategy is a set of choices, not a list of every possible marketing activity.
- Frameworks such as AARRR, funnel stages, 90-day planning, 70/20/10 allocation, or channel portfolios may organize thinking when relevant but never provide evidence or universal quotas.
- A single binding constraint is not mandatory. Preserve co-limiting, independent, or unresolved constraints when that is what the evidence supports.
- Preserve unknowns, contradictions, and non-priorities.
- Do not convert a forecast or supplied target into a promise.
- Do not describe `approved` as `implemented`, or `in execution` as `successful`.
- Do not judge plan quality by percentage of tasks completed; strategy may improve by stopping or reprioritizing work when evidence changes.
- Specialist artifacts govern specialist decisions when they conflict with this summary.
- No live mutation is authorized by this document alone.
