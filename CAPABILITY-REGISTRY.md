# Capability Registry

Declares what the Marketing OS governs, what it partially covers, and what it does not cover. The Marketing Router applies this registry before routing. A capability absent from the `Governed` table has no governed specialist, regardless of any framework, playbook, template, or export file that discusses the topic.

Status definitions:

- **Governed** — a canonical skill in `.agents/skills/` owns the capability end to end.
- **Partially covered** — a canonical skill owns a defined portion. Work outside that boundary has no specialist and must be labeled.
- **Planned** — accepted on `ROADMAP.md`, not yet built. Not available.
- **Unsupported** — no governed specialist and none currently scheduled.

Existence of a document is not coverage. A capability is governed only when a skill owns it, declares its evidence requirements, states its authorization boundary, and defines its output contract.

| Search Engine Optimization: visibility audit, technical health, content and topic strategy, ranking-change diagnosis | `$seo` |
| Copywriting: email, lifecycle, website, sales-page, long-form, brand — with paid-ad hooks staying under `$creative-strategy` and conversion-page copy under `$cro` | `$copywriting` |

## Partially covered

None currently. Requests outside the governed table must fail closed through the uncovered-request rules below rather than being silently absorbed by a neighboring skill.

Analytics engineering and BI implementation are governed by $marketing-analytics. Tracking architecture and causal measurement remain with $tracking-measurement; diagnostic interpretation remains with $performance-diagnostics; stakeholder narrative remains with $marketing-reporting.

## Planned

| Capability | Reference |
|---|---|

## Unsupported

All previously identified advertising and distribution channels, pricing/monetization, activation, retention strategy, and business-level growth strategy are governed. This registry can still contain future capability gaps.

| Capability | Boundary |
|---|---|

## Handling an uncovered request

1. Do not silently substitute the nearest channel skill.
2. Name the capability gap explicitly in the response.
3. Apply platform-agnostic frameworks only where they genuinely address a distinct part of the request.
4. Label any platform-specific guidance as ungoverned and unverified by this system.
5. Do not invent a skill name that does not exist.
6. State the gap in the response's exact-status line.
