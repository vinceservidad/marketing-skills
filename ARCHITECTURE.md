# Full-Stack Marketing OS Architecture

## Overview

Full-Stack Marketing OS is organized as a governed knowledge, skill, and workflow system for AI-assisted marketing decisions and execution.

## Distribution layers

The system has one canonical skill source and several runtime/export layers. Runtime compatibility does not make those generated copies canonical.

| Layer | Role | Executable by an agent runtime | Canonical status |
|---|---|---:|---|
| `.agents/skills/` | Portable governed operating skills | Yes, when discovered/installed by a compatible runtime | **Canonical skill source** |
| `~/.codex/skills/` | Local Codex runtime copy | Yes | Generated from canonical, never edited as source |
| `~/.claude/skills/` | Local Claude Code personal-skill copy | Yes | Generated from canonical, never edited as source |
| `CLAUDE.md` | Claude Code project-instruction bridge to `AGENTS.md` | Instructions, not a skill layer | Compatibility bridge |
| `skills/` | Compatibility/index layer | No | Must contain no competing instructions |
| `frameworks/` | Shared decision artifacts | Loaded by governed skills | Governed knowledge library |
| `playbooks/` | Scenario-specific workflows | Loaded by governed skills | Governed knowledge library |
| `templates/` | Reusable deliverable structures | Loaded by governed skills | Governed artifact library |
| `workflows/` | Execution sequences | Loaded by governed skills | Governed workflow library |
| `agents/` | Agent-role documentation | No | Documentation, not a skill layer |
| `gpt-knowledge/pack/` | Generated Custom GPT knowledge export | Retrieval/knowledge only | Derived from canonical skills, references, contracts, and supporting libraries; non-canonical |
| `integrations/` | Runtime-neutral connector/MCP/API contracts and adapter truth states | Used when a host runtime exposes an authorized tool | Governed integration boundary; connection state remains runtime-specific |
| `validation/` | Real-world evidence registry, privacy/publication rules, validation state | No | Governed evidence layer; does not create results |
| `evaluations/`, `tests/evaluations/` | Quality and decision-behavior checks | No | Governed |
| `docs/archive/` | Historical material | No | Excluded from active retrieval |

See [`DISTRIBUTION.md`](DISTRIBUTION.md) for current OpenAI/Codex/Claude support and exact installation status.

A Custom GPT export file does not imply a governed executable skill exists, and absence from the export does not imply a capability is unsupported. [`CAPABILITY-REGISTRY.md`](CAPABILITY-REGISTRY.md) is authoritative on governed capability coverage. Export/runtime coverage and governance coverage are separate claims.

Likewise, a directory of skills is not automatically a plugin. Use the term **plugin** only after the target platform's actual installable package/manifest exists and its install state has been verified.

## Core layers

### Skills

Governed instructions defining how an AI agent performs a marketing decision or workflow. Canonical source: `.agents/skills/`.

Each skill is a directory holding `SKILL.md` with YAML frontmatter (`name`, `description`) and optional `references/` loaded conditionally. Per `AGENTS.md`, every `SKILL.md` supplies a discriminating trigger description, required context, method, decision rules, output contract, and quality assurance.

The canonical structure is intentionally portable: Codex and Claude Code both support skill-style `SKILL.md` packages, while runtime-specific packaging remains a distribution concern rather than a second source hierarchy.

Capability status, governed, partially covered, planned, or unsupported, is declared in `CAPABILITY-REGISTRY.md`. Marketing analytics engineering and BI data products are owned by `$marketing-analytics`; tracking validity, causal diagnosis, stakeholder reporting, and business/channel decisions retain their existing owners. The Marketing Router will not route to a capability absent from it.

### Shared context

Project-level `.agents/marketing-context.md`, when present, is a versioned shared context summary owned by `$marketing-intake`. It reduces repeated intake but never overrides stronger specialist evidence or becomes a second source of truth.

### Frameworks

Decision models and methods that help analyze situations and choose actions. A framework organizes reasoning; it does not prove an outcome.

### Playbooks

Repeatable processes for specific business cases. Playbooks retain the decision ownership of the skill that governs them.

### Templates

Reusable formats for reports, audits, briefs, strategies, tests, and decision records.

### Workflows

Execution/coordination sequences. A documented workflow does not prove a runtime is scheduled or active.

### Evaluations

Behavioral and quality checks that reduce unsupported assumptions, ownership drift, state confusion, unsafe automation, and false certainty.

## Runtime installation

### Codex

`scripts/install-skills.sh` defaults to `~/.codex` and installs generated skill copies plus the contracts/libraries their relative links require.

### Claude Code

`scripts/install-claude-skills.sh` delegates to the same canonical installer with `~/.claude` as the runtime root. Claude Code then discovers personal skills under `~/.claude/skills/`.

Root `CLAUDE.md` imports `AGENTS.md` for repository-level contributor instructions. The runtime skill install and the project instruction bridge solve different problems and should not be conflated.

### Custom GPT / ChatGPT

`gpt-knowledge/pack/` is a generated reference export, not the executable source. `scripts/build-gpt-knowledge.py` rebuilds it from repository sources; `--check` detects drift and missing skill coverage. See [`gpt-knowledge/README.md`](gpt-knowledge/README.md) for included sources and limits. Live account access is supplied by the active host/runtime through connectors, MCP servers, APIs, browser/computer tools, or analytics/BI runtimes that satisfy [`integrations/README.md`](integrations/README.md). A dedicated marketplace plugin is optional packaging, not a prerequisite for system completeness; no adapter is described as live until its runtime-specific connection state is verified.

## Integration contract layer

The governed skill layer remains the source of decision logic. External tools are adapters, not alternate marketing brains.

Connection state is tracked separately from repository state:

documented -> configured -> authenticated -> connected -> authorized -> verified

The public repository stores adapter contracts in `integrations/`, never user credentials or an implied live session. Material writes still require the owning specialist, explicit scope authorization, pre-change state when rollback matters, and post-write verification.

## Real-world validation layer

The `validation/` registry records synthetic, anonymized-real, or verified-public evidence without upgrading one result into a universal rule. A structurally complete system may have an evidence base that continues to grow; public case-study claims require publishable evidence and permission.

## Ownership rule

Every substantial active marketing artifact must have an identifiable owner, a discoverable loading path, a declared evidence state, and a validation rule. Existence in the repository alone does not make a file part of the operating system.

`ARTIFACT-OWNERSHIP.md` records ownership for root artifacts. `scripts/validate-skill-architecture.sh` enforces canonical packaging, unique skill names, folder/frontmatter agreement, reference reachability, the prohibition on cross-layer skill impersonation, and the ownership contract for new root artifacts.

`scripts/eval.py --static` validates evaluation-case parsing, suite registration, governed owner references, and selected claim patterns. Offline tests check the harness itself; live model grading is opt-in and must retain response and source evidence. Static checks and synthetic examples are not behavioral results. See [`evaluations/README.md`](evaluations/README.md).

Generated runtime copies must never be edited into a competing owner layer. Change the canonical artifact, validate it, then reinstall/export.

## Design principles

- Strategy before execution
- Evidence before assumptions
- Business outcomes before platform metrics
- One owner per decision
- Canonical source before runtime copies
- Human judgment before automation
